In addition to a comprehensive metronome and speed trainer, Metronome Beats Pro also has a “Live Mode’ feature which allows you to create setlists of songs and play through these one by one – useful for solo and group practice as well as playing live on stage. You can also set beat and bar counters, and select from a range of different sound types.
Metronome Beats Pro is not only useful for practicing and playing musical instruments: people also use it to keep a steady tempo during exercise, golf putting practice, dancing, and many other activities.
Metronome Beats is simple to use. On smaller devices set the number of beats per bar and how you’d like the beat subdivided on the Settings screen. When you start the metronome it switches to the Practice screen, with its visual beat indicators. The practice screen has controls for easily increasing and decreasing the tempo in small increments, so you can start slow and build up your speed with one touch of the screen. On larger devices all of these features can be reached on one handy screen using the new Tablet layout.
Exclusive to Pro version:
- no adverts
- beat and bar counters
- save your settings as presets
- organise your favourite songs in to setlists and play through these in “Live” mode
Features also include:
- Select from a range of sound types (wooden claves, traditional tick, cowbell, etc)
- Separate layout for larger devices
- Select any tempo from 1 to 300 beats per minute.
- Don’t know how many beats per minute you need? Then use the tap tempo button to select a tempo.
- Displays Italian tempo markings (Allegro, Andante, etc) – handy if you’re not sure how fast Vivace should be.
- Change the pitch of the sound to make the metronome easier to hear over your instrument.
- Subdivide the beat with up to 8 clicks per beat – so you can practice the timing of your triplets.
- Choose whether to accent the first beat of the bar.
- Visual beat indication - mute the sound and use the visualisations to follow the beat.
- The metronome automatically stops playing when there is an incoming call.
- Your settings are saved automatically on exit – so you can carry on where you left off next time you play.
- The metronome keeps running when the screen is locked
- set the metronome to stop playing after a certain number of bars

It provides an easy way to improve your Swara Gyānam. The goal of the app is to train you to instantly tell any swaram you hear, to easily distinguish different swara sthanams. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced carnatic musician or rasika, you'll find this app helpful.
With Sādhakam, you'll exercise all swarasthanams thoroughly. These interactive exercises train you to hear and identify swarasthanas gradually, with increasing complexity. The exercises are crafted with pure and precise carnatic swara sthanams.
Each exercise will play a swaram or sequence to you. You shall hear and identify the correct swarasthanam among the choices presented. Once you answer, the app will tell you whether you are right or wrong, and what the correct answer is. As you practice more and more, you'll start recognizing swarams automatically. This way you can improve your swara gyanam whether you are a beginner student or an experienced musician or just a fan of carnatic music.
Mastering the 16 basic swarasthanas is fundamental for both vocalists and instrumentalists. It is even a prerequisite for manodharma sangeetham and to attain perfection in gamakam. Sādhakam helps you to achieve that in two ways:
1. It provides right set of exercises drilling different swarasthanas and combinations
2. It is interactive and lets you practice independently
The exercises are usually short. Each exercise can be done in a few minutes. So, you can practice anywhere, any time, whenever you have a few minutes to spare. You can repeat any exercise any number of times, and proceed to the next one when you feel confident. You can also explore the exercises and start working on the one that interests you at the moment depending on your mood or skill level. The app keeps track of your score and ratings.
The app plays swarams based on shruti/kattai/mane of your choice. If you wish, you may sing along with the app. Ability to sing any swarasthana at will is also a fundamental skill. This app makes it easy to achieve that.
Each exercise introduces a new concept or swaram, or revises previous concepts. If you get low score in an exercise, it means you are just beginning to learn the underlying swaram/concept. Keep observing the correct answers shown in the app and redo the exercise. You will see improvements in your score as your brain internalizes the swaram and pattern. When you see consistent high scores in a particular exercise, you would have sufficiently mastered the lesson that exercise was trying to teach you.
Each swaram is worked out in several exercises in different contexts: in arohanam, avarohanam, along with a neighbouring swaram or a distant swaram, using Sa as reference, using Pa as reference, etc. As you practice more exercises, the characteristics of the swarasthanams are etched deeply in your mind. The app also shows your progress on each swarasthana based on all the exercises you've practiced. You can use this to improve upon specific swarasthanams. For instance, you may recognize Suddha Rishabam (Ri1) in arohanam when coming from Shadjam (Sa). But you may confuse it with Chatusruti Rishabam (Ri2) when in avarohanam or while descending from a distance swaram like Thara Sthayi Sa. Or, you may normally recognize a swarasthanam in madhya sthayi, but you miss it when it comes to mandra sthayi or thara sthayi. By practicing exercises where you have difficulty in recognizing a particular swarasthana, you improve your gyānam of that swaram, which reflects as the skill level for that specific swarasthanam in the app.
NOTE
* First 2 levels with 7 exercises are free. This covers variations of Ri Ga from Sa, and Dha Ni higher Sa from Pa.
* If you find the app is helping you to improve, you can unlock all the exercises with a subscription or a one time purchase.
* There are no ads even in the free version.

Join Matt Vanacoro in this hands-on course, and discover how to get the most out of these beautiful music-making devices.
Always a forward-thinking company, ROLI is never afraid to think outside the box. After reinventing the traditional black and white keys keyboard with the Seaboard Grand and Seaboard Rise, ROLI created Blocks, an innovative way to make music. In this 27-tutorial course, Matt Vanacoro reveals how to create expressive musical performances using the whole Blocks family.
Matt starts by explaining how to charge, link and set up your Blocks together. After giving an overview of the Block devices and Noise app, he goes straight to making music… You learn how to create a new project, how to play beats, and overdub synth lines. Next thing you know, you’ll have your first patterns recorded!
Then, Matt explains how to understand the grid, how to adjust scales to easily play chords and melodies, and how to use the very unique arpeggiator. Matt reveals how to use these instruments to their full expressive potential, thanks to ROLI’s 5D touch technology.

Features: 1/1, 1/3 & 1/6 octave RTA modes, Leq (wideband, Octave, variable duration), Sones (Loudness), RT60 (wideband, Octave), Peak Store, Spectrogram, Waterfall, Peak frequency, Impulse, Fast, Medium & Slow filters, Flat & A/C Weighting and film industry X Curve, Averaging, SPL Chart Recorder, Noise Criteria (NC and NR), White/Pink Noise, Sine, Square, Triangle, Sweep, Log Sweep, Warble, Ramp and Impulse signals & loudspeaker polarity checker, L/R select. RTA Store & Load, Hann windows, pinch to zoom, scroll to center.
New in v7.6: Target Curves
New in v7.5: Sone measurement.
New in v7.4: WAV Record/Play
Exclusive ISO 1/3 Octave Calibration - can correct for your phone's microphone response. Octave calibration discs are moved up or down to obtain a flat response, and match the overall SPL to that of an external meter. Save/Restore of Cal files (popular Dayton Audio iMM-6 also supported).
Use: gig measurements, home theater, acoustics, car, etc.
AudioTool FFTs sets of microphone samples. Aliasing reduced by Hann windowing. SPL calculated in realtime. Spectra may be saved, then loaded and displayed with the live spectrum. The ""Store"" button stores the current live spectrum - ""Load"" shows a list of stored spectra to select.
To hide the buttons, tap the screen. To restore them, tap again. To zoom the scale, pinch the screen. To move the scale, drag it up or down (left or right).
A pair of cursors can be shown: each can be moved to any position, and will display the SPL & time/frequency values there. Initially, both cursors are initially positioned mid-screen - simply drag them to a new position with the fingertip. The cursors can be turned on and off in the Menu.
The loudspeaker polarity checker can be used to check whether a loudspeaker is wired in phase: connect the AudioTool output to the speaker under test, select ""Polarity"" from the signal generator screen, then return to the RTA screen. If the speaker is out of phase (polarity reversed) AudioTool will show ""Pol ---"", otherwise ""Pol +++"" if the speaker is in phase.
The Noise Criteria (available from the Menu) function shows  a set of NC contours overlaid on the 1/1 Octave RTA display and the calculated real time current NC value is also shown.
The Chart Recorder shows a moving trace of the SPL measurements over the last few minutes.
RT60 measurements can be made via the ""RT60"" button, and then using a loud clap (or similar) to trigger the measurement. RT60 can also be used with Pink Noise from the AudioTool generator. RT60 times measure how much reverberation or echo there is in a room, space or venue.
The Signal Generator generates White and Pink Noise, Sine, Square, Triangle and Ramp waves, Sine Wave Linear and Log Sweeps, Warbles and Impulses. The generator uses multiple cycled buffers, refreshed randomly so ensuring truly random White/Pink noise. Pink Noise algorithm uses Kemmet's method to adjust White into Pink.
The frequency accuracy of the generated periodic signals is typically around 1%. Sine wave fidelity is good throughout most of the audio range. Other signals' leading and trailing edges show ringing and decreasing frequency response artifacts in the upper ranges, depending on the Android used.

Our innovative learning methods help you learn a song within 15 minutes, regardless of your age and your knowledge of the music.
FAQs
Q. How is PianoGuru different from other piano learning apps?
A. Most of the typical Piano Learning apps guide you with next notes to play
by highlighting the next notes or dropping bars on next notes for a visual clue. You just follow the clue and hit the note as guided. That doesn't actually help you learn a song as you are learning one note at a time instead of learning a tune. You will never be able to play a song without guidance with that approach.
To make the learning effective, PianoGuru helps you take small baby steps towards learning a song. Each song is broken down into small verses or sequence which is a sequence of notes. Verses are carefully kept short to help you master one tune at a time. You can easily switch between the verses if you wish to. Just like a human instructor Piano Guru guides you when you are stuck by suggesting the notes to play.
Q. Does PianoGuru work in offline mode?
A. Yes. Once the app is installed, it downloads the song data and stores that in phone's memory. Thereafter the app continues to work in the offline mode.
Q. Which age-group is PianoGuru meant for?
A. PianoGuru is popular with all age groups - young kids, parents, grand-parents.
Q. How do I request a new song?
A. Just post a request on your Facebook wall with hashtag #pianoguruapp and we would add the song at earliest.
Q. Can I record my own tunes?
A. Yes you can! In fact, you can even publish your songs to help other Piano Guru users learn. We have more than 10K songs being published by Piano Guru users daily.
Q. Do I need to have music experience to learn with Piano Guru?
A. No. Based on our stats, you will be able to learn a song in less than 15 minutes (avg), regardless of your experience in music.","b""Ever wished if you could play that popular song that you always wanted to?<br/><br/>We are happy to announce PianoGuru - the most innovative piano learning app built by experts in music and virtual learning for all age groups.<br/><br/>Learn your favorite songs from our hand crafted and growing collection of 100,000+ songs comprised of English, Spanish, Bollywood, Bengali, Tamil songs.<br/><br/>Our innovative learning methods help you learn a song within 15 minutes, regardless of your age and your knowledge of the music.<br/><br/><br/>FAQs<br/><br/>Q.

But it goes even further ! For example, you could create a ""Punk Rock"" preset and a ""Hard Rock"" preset and they would be automatically selected. (Android 2.3.3+)
You can also create a preset specifically for a song, album or artist and it will be auto-detected next time you play a matching song.

FAQ
===
WHY DO YOU NEED MICROPHONE / RECORD AUDIO PERMISSION?
To be able to detect and show you the swarams, the app needs to listen to your singing or playing through your device's microphone. This requires microphone permission, sometimes referred as Record Audio permission.
HOW DO I USE THE APP?
1. Set your kattai / shruti / mane first through the orange circular button.
2. Just sing or play, the app will show you which swaram. If you are close to a swaram, it will indicate below the swaram button. Swaram button will animate once you sing or play that swaram perfectly.
3. If you want to hear, how the swaram sounds like in the selected kattai, tap the swaram button. You can stop it by tapping again.
IS THIS A SHRUTI BOX?
No. It is a tuner app. It is meant to help tuning of instruments accurately. Vocalists can also check their singing accuracy.
I AM SAYING 'Sa', BUT IT IS NOT SHOWING 'Sa'?
This app does pitch recognition; but will not consider the words. So if your singing matches the frequency of Sa swaram, it will show. Of course, first you should set your kattai / shruti / mane correctly.
WHEN I PLAY NOTE C ON MY KEYBOARD, THIS APP DOES NOT SHOW 'Sa'?
Note C on keyboards corresponds to 'Sa' in kattai 1. So first set the kattai to 1, then try. It will work as expected.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ""PURE"" CARNATIC SWARA STHANAS?
The frequency ratios of Carnatic swarams are different from Western Equal temperament (used in Keyboards and Harmoniums). Shruti Carnatic Tuner is based on authentic frequency ratios of Carnatic music. This is what we mean when we say Pure carnatic swara sthanas.
WHERE ARE THE OTHER NOTES? ONLY SA, MA1, PA ARE PROVIDED.
These swarams are sufficient for tuning most instruments. All other swarams are provided as an optional premium feature.
WHY DO I SEE ADS?
Ads help to keep our lights on while we make apps for carnatic. We are careful not to frustrate you with intrusive ads.
HOW DO I GET RID OF ADS?
You can make a simple in-app purchase which will remove ads. Thanks for your direct support.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL THE APP OR CHANGE THE PHONE? SHOULD I PURCHASE PREMIUM FEATURES AGAIN?
No. Once you make the purchase, the feature is yours ""forever"". No need to purchase again. You can uninstall and reinstall the app any number of times. No need to purchase the same feature again. Your purchase will be remembered always. This is true for any purchase.
HOW DO I REPORT A PROBLEM OR PROVIDE FEEDBACK?
You can do it through menu at top right of the app. You can also email to shruti@kuyil.org","b'Shruti helps to tune your instruments or voice to accurate Carnatic swarams.

Bird Sounds and Bird Caller:
This Bird Songs app/guide has all types of bird vocalizations including Bird songs and Bird calls like alarms, flight calls, distress calls etc. which you can set as bird ringtones.
The distinction between bird songs and bird calls is based upon complexity, length, and context. Bird songs are longer and more complex and are associated with courtship and mating, while bird calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact.

Listening to natural sounds like the sound of waves or rain and bird sounds are proven to be excellent forms of sound therapy. So if you’ve had a particularly stressful day at work, just relax and sleep by listening to the sounds of songbirds like Nightingales, Skylarks and Wrens and let all your worries and stress ebb away.

The only metronome that gives you complete control over how subdivisions are played -- add up to 10 subdivisions of any type (including custom subdivisions like 5/7) and have them played all the time, at random intervals, or in a sequenced pattern.
Features:
- Choose from 40 different samples for each subdivision, mastered for volume
- Generate patterns using random or sequenced variations of different subdivisions
- Include preset patterns such as claves or ride cymbal patterns
- Choose any number of beats per measure you like or practice mixed meters such as 4 + 3 + 5 where the segments of the bar get accented automatically
- Use any type of subdivision. Common types like quarter notes, sixteenth notes, eighth triplets, etc, or create your own. 5/7, 23/4, no problem!
- Take a rhythm and use the ""offset"" feature to move it to different parts of the measure to practice with.
- Email saved metronomes back and forth with other Metronomics users
- Track your metronome usage.
- Train yourself with ""independence"" mode where you can set some bars to be inaudible -- keep the time going yourself until the click starts again
- Variable swing feel -- choose how much each subdivision swings
- Play in the background
- Normalized sounds for good volume

FAQ
What is TGIIR?
The Great Indian Indie Recordings (TGIIR, aka THANK GOD IT'S IN RUPEES)  is the world’s 1st artist-funding community with a proven Track Record.
How long has this been going on?
Since 2013, We have been paying indie artists to produce their LIVE performance videos and give them audio copyrights of the same. We have already funded over 300 such acts with well over 1500 original songs & recordings. In 2016, we also built a performance venue OOHeaven where we can can invite audiences to fund band recordings.
Whose initiative is this? Who takes responsibility to deliver?
Aum-I-Art Foundation (a not-for-profit music trust), and
Aum-i Artistes (The artist & media company behind #musicmojo #TheMuseRoom #HOME #Alt&Pepper #ooHeaven etc)
What is TGIIR's vision?
TGIIR invites like minded music lovers to invest ₹99/- a month. This will help fund multiple recordings of various Indie Stars. We are already ready with TGIIR Version.1. We ask that you join us and grow this movement even more.
How? Where does my ₹99/- go?
The money is channeled through Aum-i-Art Foundation (a registered Music Trust) and 1/3rd will be used to pay a royalty to all enrolled artists whose music is featured on TGIIR, 1/3rd will be used to meet the infrastructural and operational expenses of the trust and 1/3rd will be used to pay artists to record new songs, LIVE before their fans at various venues like OOHeaven which have been equipped with the requisite infrastructure.
With the artists permission 1 or more of their songs are recorded, mixed, mastered and marketed as LIVE Recordings, which are then featured on TGIIR.
Hence, you are contributing towards rewarding and recording independent artists and you have a track record to show for it.
We let the artist retain copyright,...
So yes, this is a musical revolution
How does the app work?
The TGIIR app has a dual function. It is a donor app (if you want to help grow this movement) and a track record (of those already in it)
Can we hear more Indian Indie Content here?
We guarantee the presence of all the TGIIR compilations and songs & will gladly feature other Indian Indie recordings with their permissions. For eg it is safe to assume we would curate and feature the songs we like from music mojo, muse room & other properties that we are associated in. Also you will be sure to find all those indie songs of bands that we are fans of. In fact pls ask your favourite artists to join us & benefit both monetarily & otherwise on TGIIR.
Because like most of you joining us here, we believe; some fans mean business!

Each parameter can be linked to different directions of motion. Contains presets, WAV recording, a stepped arpeggiator with diatonic scale locking, a multi-pattern sequencer, wave shaping oscillators, resonant filter with envelope and pitch following, and an effects rig (including formant (vowel) filter, pitched delay, reverb, down-sample, bit reduction.) Capable of strange sonic textures, complex evolving arpeggios, or classic sequenced synth sounds.
Notes are generated with a sequencer and keyboard. The sequencer works by moving a step at the rate specified. There are four patterns that can be played and edited independently.
The keyboard has a set of notes that can be played or buttons which hold notes. Held notes can be cut off by sequencer notes and play notes of the same pitch.
The arpeggiator receives notes from the sequencer and keyboard. Its rate is controlled by both synced time and ms that are added together. It has variable steps, step transpose and gate. The steps and timing can be reset periodically with the optional arp reset. There is optional diatonic scale locking as well, allowing you to select a root note and scale from major, dorian, phyrygian, lydian, mixolydian, minor, and locrian.
The synth's sounds are generated with five voices, each with two oscillators that modulate between triangle and saw. Modulation is effected by an envelope. There is a pitch envelope that effects both oscillators. The oscillators are capable of fm (osc B modifying osc A.) Both oscillators can have their signals sent to the filter or directly to the amp envelope. A white noise signal can also be added to the filter or directly to the amp envelope.
The filter is a 4 pole resonant band-pass whose frequency can follow the pitch. It is also effected by its own ADSR envelope. The filtered and unfiltered signal is sent to a per voice down sample and per voice delay under synth menu. All voices are sent to an effect rig with a formant (vowel) filter, pitched delay, reverb, and bit reduction. Presets and WAV files are stored at /device root/fang/.
Four sub parameters for each parameter to adjust left, right, back, and forward accelerometer input
Save and load presets
Export audio as WAV (exported to /device root/fang/)
4 pattern 8 step sequencer with adjustable rate
Stepped arpeggiator with sync and ms rate control

“This is a must-have for anyone wanting an encyclopedia of world percussion rhythms at their fingertips.”
PercussionTutor is an educational app for dedicated world percussion enthusiasts. The app and its free creative commons licensed companion book feature a unique library of world rhythms and instruments played by leading percussionists and drummers. A time stretching feature and a metronome give the users the option to practice at their own pace. Sheets and notes are included for all the rhythms.
NO IN-APP PURCHASES! Make sure to buy the app now and get all the future content for free. We will release updates on a regular basis adding new rhythms and videos (for the iOS version we kept our promise since April 2012!).
PercussionTutor will allow you to approach South American, Caribbean and West African music in a different way. This app offers you more than a simple play-along. It includes standard notation, videos (COMING NEXT ANDROID UPDATE!) and specific claves. We also took the outmost care to capture the natural feeling of all those drumming traditions.
For the batá rhythms we even developed a random playback engine that will simulate an actual batá performance.
This app puts you in a live playing situation - just like you learned your mother language. You will sound more natural and more alive and you will awaken to new rhythmic possibilities. It's also a great tool for other musicians, dancers and performers who want to immerse themselves into centuries-old traditional languages.

The Sunderkand which is a chapter in the 'Ram-Charit-Maanas', penned by Goswami Tulsidas is considered to be as auspicious to read, as it is to recite the 'Hanuman Chaalisa'.
हनुमान जयंती ki dhero badhai
Hanuman Jayanti ki dhero badhai
Sundar Kand is the story of Hanumanji and his searching of Mata Sita in Lanka.
In the Sunderkand, Hanumanji is reminded by Jambavan about the fact that Hanumanji has great powers that the latter has no memory of. In this case Hanumanji is made to remember about the fact that he is capable of flying. Jambavan exhorted Hanuman to undertake the crossing of the Mighty Ocean.
Hanuman Chalisa is hindi poem written by Mahakavi Goswami Tulsidas in the sixteenth century in praise of Lord Hanuman.
The Bajrang Baan is a very powerful prayer dedicated to the hindu god hanuman.The literal meaning of the bajrang baan is the arrow of bajrang bali or hanuman. The recitation of the bajrang baan early in the morning or just before going to bed is recommended.

You can build a collection of stage plots for different kinds of gigs, then print or email them directly from your mobile device.
A tablet is recommended for building stage plots. Once you build a stage plot, you can copy it to your phone for quick access on the go.
Stage plots can include a diagram to show the placement of elements on stage; numbered input and output lists; a list of other required items like chairs and music stands; the name and photo of each performer; notes for the sound engineer; and your contact info.
The app includes graphics for the following items:
- Inputs: vocal mic, instrument mic, area mic, clip mic, kick drum mic, DI box, XLR input
- Outputs: wedge monitor, spot monitor, fill monitor, in-ear monitor, headphone amp
- Instruments: amp, cymbal, drum, kick drum, keyboard, grand piano, pedal steel, xylophone
- Other: stairs, riser, stool, chair, music stand, horn stand, guitar stand, guitar rack, power outlet, mixer, laptop, isolation panel, fan
This app does not include graphics for small instruments that performers carry with them onto the stage, only large instruments like keyboards and drums that require prior placement on stage. The app design assumes that graphics for smaller instruments clutter stage plots and are relatively unimportant to the sound engineers and stage techs who will use them. Instead of a graphic for these instruments, stage plots can include a graphic for the input they use (a mic or DI box) with a custom label like ""trumpet mic"" or ""DI for acoustic guitar."" If you do not agree with this approach to stage plot design, or if you want to make stage plots that look different from the examples shown in the screen shots and demo video, you should select a different app.

A new kind of metronome -- use Metronomics to generate random patterns, sequenced grooves, or a combination of both to help you practice with more than just your typical click track. Enough features to keep a professional busy for years or start a beginner on the right track.
The only metronome that gives you complete control over how subdivisions are played -- add up to 10 subdivisions of any type (including custom subdivisions like 5/7) and have them played all the time, at random intervals, or in a sequenced pattern.
Features:
- Choose from 40 different samples for each subdivision, mastered for volume
- Generate patterns using random or sequenced variations of different subdivisions
- Include preset patterns such as claves or ride cymbal patterns
- Choose any number of beats per measure you like or practice mixed meters such as 4 + 3 + 5 where the segments of the bar get accented automatically
- Use any type of subdivision. Common types like quarter notes, sixteenth notes, eighth triplets, etc, or create your own. 5/7, 23/4, no problem!
- Take a rhythm and use the ""offset"" feature to move it to different parts of the measure to practice with.
- Email saved metronomes back and forth with other Metronomics users
- Track your metronome usage.
- Train yourself with ""independence"" mode where you can set some bars to be inaudible -- keep the time going yourself until the click starts again
- Variable swing feel -- choose how much each subdivision swings
- Play in the background
- Normalized sounds for good volume
- Web-based manual describing how to use all the features and hints about how they might be useful","b'A metronome for real musicians.

SYNTH PARAMETERS
Bass drum-
Freq: Frequency. Locks into semitones so you an harmonize easily
Decay: Amplitude decay
Freq Env Dec: Frequency envelope decay. Changes how fast the pitch drops
Freq Env Amt: Frequency envelope amount. Changes how much the pitch drops
Noise: Noise burst for click
Amp: Bass drum amp
Snare drum-
Tone Low Dec: Tone low decay
Tone High Dec: Tone high decay
Noise Dec: Noise decay
FM: Frequency modulate the low tone by the high tone
Freq: Frequency. Locks into semitones so you an harmonize easily, though overtones from fm and the high tone bring inharmonic tones
Freq Env: Frequency envelope. Changes how much the pitch drops
Delay: Feedback delay
Delay ms: Milliseconds of delay
Tone Distance: Distance between low and high tones
Amp: Volume of snare
Hi-Hat-
Freq: Frequency
FM: Frequency modulate the tone
Tone Dec: Tone decay
Tone Amp: Tone amplitude
Noise Dec: Noise decay
Noise Amp: Tone amplitude
EFFECTS
Retrig: Loop audio by the specified time interval (1/2, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 notes)
Rev: reverse retrigger’s playback
Speed: control the speed of the retrigger’s playback
Bit Red: Bit reducer. Mixes in a low bit signal
BP Filt: Band-pass filter. All the way left is off
Tanh: Amplifies and the waveshapes the signal through a hyperbolic tangent curve. Creates a tape-like distortion
Asym: Adds to the signal, creating a DC offset. Doesn’t do much unless you have Tanh turned a bit
Down Samp: Down-sample the signal
Reverb: Mixes in reverb signal
Delay: Pitched feedback delay dry/wet
Delay ms: Milliseconds of delay
Freq: Adjust the pitch that the delayed signal is adjusted by. Also locks into semitones","b'Dragon is a drum machine built to quickly and easily make glitch, distorted, lofi drum beats and manipulate them live.

[3] Not every music player app supports rewind / fast forward
With a 3-button headset, volume control is also configurable with the left and right headset buttons.
Music app selection
Headset Button Controller controls the currently running music app. You are also able to explicitly specify which installed music app you want to control.
Volume control features
Headset Button Controller remembers the music volume when the headphone is unplugged and can restore it when the headphone is plugged in again.
* Min volume limit: Start volume level of the 'volume control' command
* Max volume limit: Ensures that the headset music volume never exceeds this limit
Call features
You are also able to control calls with the headset button:
* answer call / end call on single press (configurable)
* decline call / mute microphone on double press (configurable)
* adjust volume during a call (see volume control)
* announce caller name (Text-To-Speech required)
You can also configure Headset Button Controller to automatically answer an incoming call after a configurable delay.
Headset plug in / out
You can configure an action to be performed when the headset gets plugged in / out.
Profiles
You can create different 'configuration profiles' which you can switch between. Add a widget or a shortcut to your home screen to easily change your profile. It is also possible to switch profile from the 'Tasker' or 'Locale' app (Locale plug-in). All settings can be backed up on SD card.
