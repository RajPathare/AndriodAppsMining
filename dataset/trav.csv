With your trusty Vegan guide, you can be sure of finding vegan food in restaurants around the globe.
This multilingual vegan guide is a must-have for globetrotting vegans. It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.
The fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.
Including fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.
When visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.
If booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.
If all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.
When booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.
The Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.
What do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.
We also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism.","b'Travel the world with confidence and enjoy local dishes without compromising your vegan beliefs!

Recommended by visitnorway.com 28/6 2014.
Also check out our new app ""In Sight Svalbard"" with completely offline high resolution maps.
* Offline Augmented Reality in Norway *
See what's near you where you travel in Norway: Mountains, Lakes, Places, Buildings, etc. You don't even have to be nearby Norway: You can manually set your location to a place in Norway to pretend you are there. Decide if you want to see places nearby, or famous cities around the world.
Works everywhere: By the sea, in the mountains, in the city. Without the internet, without coverage.
Turn the phone sideways to view on the camera screen the places that are nearby. Take a picture of what you see, and send it by email, or post it on facebook, directly from the App!
You can also add your own places!
In Sight Norway+ is also an altimeter, speedometer and also estimates the distance you've traveled. Choose between metric (km, meter) or imperial (miles, feet) units.
All data is built into the App, so you don't need internet. You only need internet when you use the map or send a picture on email or post it on facebook. High-resolution maps down to a scale of 1:70 000 don’t require internet. For finer resolution internet is used.
Select between the following map types: Standard, Satellite, Hybrid, High Resolution and Sea Map. High resolution maps and sea maps are provided by the Norwegian Mapping Authority.
In Sight Norway+ relies on the compass and GPS of your device. Best results are achieved if you are outside.
COMPASS CALIBRATION AND ACCURACY.
One way to calibrate the compass is to move the phone in an 8-number manner 3 times: Once when the phone is in landscape, once in portrait and once facing up. Also stay away from magnetic sources that might influence the compass. For the compass to be accurate under usage, you have to be outside to get a good location reading.

● ОФФЛАЙН КАРТА ВЕНЕЦИИ. В путешествии Вам больше не потребуется роуминг интернет соединения для просмотра карты города.
● КАТАЛОГ ДОСТОПРИМЕЧАТЕЛЬНОСТЕЙ ВЕНЕЦИИ. Каталог включает более 130 специально отобранных интереснейших объектов Венеции. Это основные исторические и культурные достопримечательности Венеции, ее острова и музеи.
● КАЧЕСТВЕННЫЕ ФОТОГРАФИИ. Фотографии мест, входящих в каталог, позволят быстрее сориентироваться и выделить нужное из всего многообразия Венецианских пейзажей.
● ОПИСАНИЯ И РАССКАЗЫ. Описания профессионально подготовлены на русском языке о каждом интересном месте и включают справочную информацию, в т.ч.  как добраться, время работы и др.
● АУДИОГИД ПО ВЕНЕЦИИ. Рассказы аудиогида озвучены профессиональным диктором на студии звукозаписи. Прослушивание рассказов поможет не отвлекаться при осмотре достопримечательностей, не терять время и не портить зрение, читая на ходу текст на небольшом экране.
● НАВИГАЦИОННЫЕ ТЕХНОЛОГИИ. Удобные мелочи XXI века, которые отобразят ваше местоположение на карте, а также включат рассказы аудиогида, когда вы просто подойдете к объекту осмотра.
● ЭКСКУРСИИ ПО ВЕНЕЦИИ. Воспользуйтесь тремя предварительно составленными обзорными экскурсионными маршрутами по Венеции, включив автоматический режим экскурсии.
● ПРОГУЛКИ ПО ВЕНЕЦИИ. Венеция – город-музей под открытым небом. Мы рекомендуем самостоятельно гулять по городу, наслаждаясь его видами и историей. К тому-же не все интересные места, которые стоит посетить, попадают в экскурсионные маршруты. В первую очередь это касается отдельных островов Венецианской лагуны, таких как  Мурано и Бурано,  но также и разных других достопримечательностей. Составьте свой собственный план осмотра, просто выбрав в каталоге нужные места, и они сразу будут отображены на карте.  При этом остальные объекты вы можете просто убрать с карты.
● КРАТКИЙ РАЗГОВОРНИК. Разговорник поможет при необходимости  быстро подобрать нужное слово.

There are 135+ audio points that play automatically, featuring what to see, stories, tips and advice. All the benefits of a guided tour, the freedom to drive yourself.
TOUR GUIDE AS YOU DRIVE AROUND ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK
If you like driving yourself when you go sightseeing, GyPSy Guide™ tour apps allow you to enjoy a guided tour experience while remaining totally independent. By driving yourself, you'll be able to get from place to place faster, see more things and not be tied to anyone else's schedule.
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST SIGHTS AND STORIES
The tour apps use your device’s location abilities to play the commentary AUTOMATICALLY. All you have to do is drive, listen and decide which places you want to stop at. Our tour guides have created an insightful and entertaining tour of Rocky Mountain National Park. We’ll recommend the best places to experience and some great locations that most visitors will drive by.
PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY
GyPSy Guide knows where you are and which direction you are heading, and plays commentary automatically about the things you are seeing, plus stories and tips and advice.
EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL
It’s just like having a local friend to show you around. And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.
GREAT VALUE
The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.
WORKS OFFLINE
No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data – even visiting from another country.
DRIVING TOUR ROUTE
Start the tour from either Estes Park or Grand Lake. The tour includes the most popular sightseeing places and much more:
1) Trail Ridge Road
2) Old Fall River Road
3) Alpine Visitor Center
4) Bear Lake
5) Horseshoe Park
6) Rock Cut
7) Gore Range Overlook
The tour is designed that you can drive it one way from either side or you can drive from one entrance to another and then back. The commentary provides all the major highlights each way, but different stories depending on which way you go.
NOTES
Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.
++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.

Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data \xe2\x80\x93 even visiting from another country. <br/><br/>DRIVING TOUR ROUTE<br/><br/>Start the tour from either Estes Park or Grand Lake. The tour includes the most popular sightseeing places and much more:<br/><br/>    1) Trail Ridge Road<br/>    2) Old Fall River Road<br/>    3) Alpine Visitor Center<br/>    4) Bear Lake<br/>    5) Horseshoe Park<br/>    6) Rock Cut<br/>    7) Gore Range Overlook<br/><br/>The tour is designed that you can drive it one way from either side or you can drive from one entrance to another and then back. The commentary provides all the major highlights each way, but different stories depending on which way you go.<br/><br/><br/>NOTES<br/><br/>Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.  <br/><br/>++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.<br/><br/><br/>ABOUT US<br/><br/>GyPSy Guide\xe2\x84\xa2 produce award winning audio tours along scenic drives around the world.

The Camino Portugues App builds off of the success of the other Wise Pilgrim Guides, which are now in their 5th season... the original camino app.
This guide covers the route from Lisbon to Porto, and from Porto to Santiago de Compostela along the 'Central Way',  as well as the 'Coastal Route'.
Accommodation Directory:
A full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  With special attention to those that can be booked online.
Stageless Guide:
No more ""stage anxiety"" or guide created bottlenecks.
Location Aware:
Every location is geo-coded.  Devices with GPS enabled will display actual distance from every point (albergue, church, city, etc.) within the app.  Devices without GPS will instead show measured distances between points.
Photos:
Photos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.
Maps:
If you have a data connection, or are connected to wifi, you can view the locations of every point  on a map. Unfortunately, this feature is unavailable without a connection.
Scrollable Elevation Map:
This one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.
Comments:
Albergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.

TrekRight includes detailed *offline* maps, handy reference information, comprehensive walking directions, and powerful location-aware functionality that enables you to simply enjoy your walk.
--- The Right Information, When You Need it ---
Location-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Kalkan, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what attractions are available around you, where you can find a water fountain, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favorites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!
--- Trekopedia ---
TrekRight’s ‘Lycian Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Accommodation, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, Route Sections, and Articles. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!
--- Interactive Offline Maps ---
Powerful, flexible map built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed *offline* map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Scroll, zoom, and rotate the map. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the Lycian Way.
--- Intelligent Compass ---
In addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!
--- Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation ---
TrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / pensions, flag locations of interest as ‘favorites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!
--- Up-To-Date Content ---
TrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to Google Play. Always be up to date!

Built from the same up to date database as the other Wise Pilgrim Apps and Guidebooks, 'Wisely' was designed to fill the two most requested needs for pilgrims:
Offline Mapping:  Download the maps to your phone while you have an internet connection, and enjoy them while you are on the trail.  The offline maps are designed for the outdoors and are rendered to show the elevation changes along the route.  Map markers include all cities, 900+ accommodation options, notable landmarks along the way, and notices about deviations and alternative routes along the way.  A click on the pin brings up a description of the route, distances, services available in any given place and accommodation details.

Rastplatser,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/D1qraFOPHOc3cfj_lQ3dLeuqAkA_M6N10zPlcLgoGvc6YOs7JvWmk-9P0jlVbisM5aY,8,,['TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL'],4.1,"{5: 9, 4: 2, 3: 3, 2: 1, 1: 1}",16,"Runt om i landet finns drygt 350 rastplatser som förvaltas och sköts på uppdrag av Trafikverket.
Standard och utrustning är lite olika på de olika rastplatserna, men det gemensamma för dem är att du ska kunna använda dem oavsett om du har något funktionshinder eller inte. Här finns också toaletter, informationstavlor, sittplatser med bord och soptunnor.
Trafikverkets rastplatser är inte till för långtidsuppställda husbilar och husvagnar (och därför de oftast inte kan användas som ställplatser) utan för trafikanter som stannar en stund och kopplar av.
Planera din resa och besök någon av landets vackra rastplatser och utnyttja möjligheten till en paus på resan. Här kan du se var trafikverkets rastplatser finns, vilken standard de har och vilken service erbjuds.
Rastplatserna ser olika ut, men gemensamt är att alla ska vara anpassade både för personer med och utan funktionshinder. Vanligtvis finns informationstavlor, bord och bänkar för att trafikanterna ska kunna äta medhavd färdkost och möjlighet att slänga sopor från resan. Dessutom brukar det finnas toaletter. På en del finns även möjlighet att tömma lösa latriner. Ibland finns restaurang och bensinstation med mera nära rastplatsen, men de räknas inte alltid som tillhörande rastplatsen, utan är rent privata anläggningar. Rastplatserna ska också skötas om regelbundet. På rastplatsbyggnaden finns en skylt, där entreprenören ska anteckna senaste städtidpunkt och signera vem som utfört städningen.
Ett finmaskigt nät av trygga rastplatser med god kapacitet, rätt funktionalitet och i gott skick ger förutsättning för yrkeschaufförer att kunna utföra effektiva transporter inom ramen för lagstadgade kör- och vilotider. För yrkeschaufförer är vägen och dess sidoanläggningar såsom rastplatser självklart viktig del av arbetsmiljön, även om arbetsgivaren inte råder över den. Därför ställs högre krav på rastplatser utifrån yrkeschaufförers behov (till exempel sanitärt) än för hobbytrafikanters behov.
Bra rastplatser inbjuder till nödvändiga stopp för vila och rekreation. Trötthet vid ratten är en vanlig olycksfaktor nästan att jämföra med olyckor relaterade till alkohol. Så om något inte stämmer överens med hur det borde vara, om du får något problem på rastplatsen, rapportera vänligen till geoinfo.apps@gmail.com och/eller direkt till Trafikverkets kundtjänst (Telefon: 0771-921 921).
Frågor och svar om rastplatser:
1. Vem ansvarar för informationstavlorna på rastplatserna?
- Det är Trafikverket som ansvarar för informationstavlorna. De ska vara tillgängliga året runt, även för personer med funktionshinder. På en del rastplatser har kommunen fått tillstånd att sätta upp kartor och information om besöksmål i närheten.
2. Hur ofta ska toaletterna städas?
- Tillsyn, städning och skötsel av rastplats och toaletter ska utföras två gånger per dygn, en gång mellan klockan 6 och 10 och en gång mellan klockan 15 och 20 alla dagar under perioden 1 juni–31 augusti och en gång per dygn övrig tid av året.På rastplatsbyggnaden finns en skylt, där entreprenören ska anteckna senaste städtidpunkt och signera vem som har städat.
3. Varför går det inte att tömma en fast latrin på rastplatserna?
- På rastplatskartan kan du se vilka rastplatser som har latrintömning. De anläggningar som finns är bara avsedda för lösa latriner. På större campingplatser och på en del bensinmackar går det att tömma fasta latriner.
4. Går det att tömma gråvatten och lösa latriner på alla rastplatser?
- Nej, gråvatten kan du inte tömma alls. Det får inte blandas med latrintömning.
5. Hur länge får man stå med sin husvagn eller husbil på en rastplats?
- Våra rastplatser är främst avsedda för tillfällig rast och vila, inte för övernattning. På rastplatser och skyltade P-platser är det dock i grunden tillåtet att stå högst 24 timmar.","b'Runt om i landet finns drygt 350 rastplatser som f\xc3\xb6rvaltas och sk\xc3\xb6ts p\xc3\xa5 uppdrag av Trafikverket.<br/><br/>Standard och utrustning \xc3\xa4r lite olika p\xc3\xa5 de olika rastplatserna, men det gemensamma f\xc3\xb6r dem \xc3\xa4r att du ska kunna anv\xc3\xa4nda dem oavsett om du har n\xc3\xa5got funktionshinder eller inte.

Now in their 6th year as a mobile app, and their 9th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.
The app is updated regularly with new content and new features.
This guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irun to Santiago, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline.  To use the map features, or to share your comments with other guide owners, will require a data connection.  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.
Accommodation Directory:
A full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales with special attention to those that can be booked online.
Stageless Guide:
No more ""stage anxiety"" or guide created bottlenecks.
Location Aware:
Every location is geo-coded.  Devices with GPS enabled will display actual distance from every point (albergue, church, city, etc.) within the app.  Devices without GPS will instead show measured distances between points.
Photos:
Photos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.
Maps:
If you have a data connection, or are connected to wifi, you can view the locations of every point  on a map. Unfortunately, this feature is unavailable without a connection.
Scrollable Elevation Map:
This one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.
Comments:
Albergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.

Рим - оффлайн гид и карта от Blogoitaliano.com,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RsIHqW--1fkzmUiuFXQuZDDhzAYEUfQNL26ZdwBnVMomJaGUrGvBxX8x7AgV449ZAGIH,6,,['TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL'],3.6,"{5: 5, 4: 0, 3: 1, 2: 1, 1: 2}",9,"Приложение «Рим - оффлайн гид и карта» - это удобный и функциональный путеводитель по одному из наиболее интересных городов мира – Риму, специально составленный, чтобы Вы получили максимум впечатлений от своей поездки.
Здесь Вы найдете актуальные сведения о популярных достопримечательностях и развлечениях, ресторанах и пиццериях, магазинах и аутлетах; информацию о транспорте, примечательных и малоизвестных местах для гурманов, часах работы и ценах на билеты в главные туристические объекты, чтобы ничего не пропустить и успеть все.
Путешественники, желающие максимально погрузиться в изучение Италии, найдут готовые планы для поездок на 1 день из Рима в самые интересные города поблизости.
Чтобы Вам было легче в незнакомом городе, в приложении реализована удобная карта со всеми нанесенными объектами, которая работает даже без интернета. А ориентироваться еще проще можно, используя фильтры с привязкой к популярным достопримечательностям. Например, чтобы отыскать самое вкусное мороженое по маршруту Вашей прогулки. Просто установите приложение, и вся информация у Вас под рукой.
Каждый объект в приложении сопровождается фото, описанием, ориентировочным уровнем цен и рекомендациями, на что обратить внимание. Ведь Рим – это настоящий музей под открытым небом, и путешественники часто упускают из виду всемирно известные шедевры просто потому, что они скрыты за фасадами вполне заурядных зданий.
Помимо стандартных рубрик, с помощью функции «Избранное» Вы можете составить свой личный топ-лист интересных мест, чтобы легко находить самое важное.
Всю информацию в приложении собрал Алекс - автор blogoitaliano.com - одного из самых популярных сайтов об Италии в рунете. Ежегодно blogoitaliano помогает сотням тысяч путешественников лучше спланировать свою поездку в Италию.
В мобильном гиде по Риму Вы найдете:
- более 200 мест, куда сходить, что посмотреть, где поесть и чем заняться;
- чем примечательно каждое место и на что обратить внимание;
- расписание работы достопримечательностей и стоимость билетов;
- карта с GPS к каждому объекту, работающая без интернета;
- функция ""Избранное"" для создания собственного списка мест;
- более 80 кафе и ресторанов, включая как колоритные заведения для «перекуса» на ходу, так и рестораны с мишленовскими звездами;
- более 60 главных и «секретных» достопримечательностей
- Подборку самых интересных музеев в каждом городе
- Основные аутлеты, торговые центры и рынки
- Не менее 5 готовых планов для поездок  на 1 день
- Подробное руководство по общественному транспорту и такси

- Отдельные разделы, посвященные особенностям поездок в каждый из городов
Гид по Риму регулярно обновляется и наполняется свежей информацией.

GyPSy Guide GPS driving tour of Jasper National Park is a great way to the experience the Rockies biggest national park. There are 108 audio points that play automatically, featuring what to see, stories, tips and advice. All the benefits of a guided tour, the freedom to drive yourself.
TOUR GUIDE AS YOU DRIVE THE ROCKIES
If you like driving yourself when you go sightseeing, GyPSy Guide™ tour apps allow you to enjoy a guided tour experience while remaining totally independent. By driving yourself, you'll be able to get from place to place faster, see more things and not be tied to anyone else's schedule.
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST SIGHTS AND STORIES
The tour apps use your device’s location abilities to play the commentary AUTOMATICALLY. All you have to do is drive, listen and decide which places you want to stop at. Our tour guides have created insightful and entertaining tours of the Rockies. We’ll recommend the best places to see and some great locations that most visitors don't get to see.
PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY
GyPSy Guide knows where you are and which direction you are heading, and plays commentary automatically about the things you are seeing, plus stories and tips and advice.
EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL
It’s just like having a local friend to show you around. And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.
GREAT VALUE
The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.
WORKS OFFLINE
No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data – even visiting from another country.
DRIVING TOUR ROUTE
The tour includes the most popular sightseeing stops and many more:
1) Maligne Canyon
2) Maligne Lake
3) Miette Hotsprings
4) Pyramid Lake
5) Jasper Tramway
6) Old Fort Point
7) Jasper Park Lodge
You can join the tour anywhere along the route. A good place to start is from in the town of Jasper. If staying at the Jasper Park Lodge, you will join the tour as you exit the lodge.
CANADIAN ROCKIES APP BUNDLE
This tour is a part of a set of tour apps by GyPSy Guide to explore the Canadian Rockies National Parks. Other tours in the series include:
*  Banff Townsite Tour
*  Banff Lake Louise Yolo
*  Icefields Parkway
*  And Calgary to Banff (Free)
NOTES
Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.
++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.

There are 160+ audio points that play automatically, featuring what to see, stories, tips and advice. All the benefits of a guided tour, the freedom to drive yourself.
TOUR GUIDE AS YOU DRIVE AROUND GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK
If you like driving yourself when you go sightseeing, GyPSy Guide™ tour apps allow you to enjoy a guided tour experience while remaining totally independent. By driving yourself, you'll be able to get from place to place faster, see more things and not be tied to anyone else's schedule.
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST SIGHTS AND STORIES
The tour apps use your device’s location abilities to play the commentary AUTOMATICALLY. All you have to do is drive, listen and decide which places you want to stop at. Our tour guides have created an insightful and entertaining tour of Grand Teton. We’ll recommend the best places to experience and some great locations that most visitors will drive by.
PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY
GyPSy Guide knows where you are and which direction you are heading, and plays commentary automatically about the things you are seeing, plus stories and tips and advice.
EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL
It’s just like having a local friend to show you around. And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.
GREAT VALUE
The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.
WORKS OFFLINE
No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data – even visiting from another country.
DRIVING TOUR ROUTE
The tour includes the most popular sightseeing stops and many more:
1) Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake Area
2) Snake River and eastern highway side
3) Colter Bay and north end of park
4) Moose area
5) Moose Wilson Corridor
You can join the tour from any of the 4 park entrances or anywhere along the route. Many people start in the town of Jackson or start the tour as they are leaving Yellowstone.
NOTES
Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.
++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.

And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.<br/><br/>GREAT VALUE<br/><br/>The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.<br/><br/>WORKS OFFLINE<br/><br/>No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data \xe2\x80\x93 even visiting from another country. <br/><br/>DRIVING TOUR ROUTE<br/><br/>The tour includes the most popular sightseeing stops and many more:<br/><br/>    1) Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake Area<br/>    2) Snake River and eastern highway side<br/>    3) Colter Bay and north end of park<br/>    4) Moose area<br/>    5) Moose Wilson Corridor<br/><br/>You can join the tour from any of the 4 park entrances or anywhere along the route. Many people start in the town of Jackson or start the tour as they are leaving Yellowstone.<br/><br/><br/>NOTES<br/><br/>Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.  <br/><br/>++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.<br/><br/><br/>ABOUT US<br/><br/>GyPSy Guide\xe2\x84\xa2 produce award winning audio tours along scenic drives around the world.  Enjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience.  Our goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and perhaps inspire you to learn more and return.

E-walk allows you to download offline maps, to plan your treks, to show and share your position, to record your treks, etc... This makes E-walk the perfect companion for outdoors activities (such as trekking, hiking, fishing, hunting, etc...) and for traveling abroad, because you can fully use it offline.
Lost in a forest? E-walk brings you back to your car. Forgot about where was this lovely boutique you noticed last year in Venice? E-walk refreshes your memory!

• show your current location on the map
• search places (last searches are saved for offline use)

• share your position via e-mail or SMS

GyPSy Guide GPS driving tour of the Banff Townsite is a great way to the see best attractions that are close to Banff. There are 100+ audio points that play automatically, featuring what to see, stories, tips and advice. All the benefits of a guided tour, the freedom to drive yourself.
TOUR GUIDE AS YOU DRIVE THE CANADIAN ROCKIES
If you like driving yourself when you go sightseeing, GyPSy Guide™ tour apps allow you to enjoy a guided tour experience while remaining totally independent. By driving yourself, you'll be able to get from place to place faster, see more things and not be tied to anyone else's schedule
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST SIGHTS AND STORIES
The tour apps use your device’s location abilities to play the commentary AUTOMATICALLY. All you have to do is drive, listen and decide which places you want to stop at. Our tour guides have created insightful and entertaining tours of the Rockies. We’ll recommend the best places to see and some great locations that most visitors don't get to see.
PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY
GyPSy Guide knows where you are and which direction you are heading, and plays commentary automatically about the things you are seeing, plus stories and tips and advice.
EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL
It’s just like having a local friend to show you around. And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.
GREAT VALUE
The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.
WORKS OFFLINE
No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no data charges – even visiting from another country.
DRIVING TOUR ROUTE
There are many highlights on this tour and these are just a few:
* Bow Falls
* Banff Gondola and Hot Springs
* Cave and Basin
* Lake Minnewanka
* Mount Norquay
* Vermilion Lakes
* and many more spectacular sites
The tour is a loop and you can join anywhere along the route.  We recommend 1/2 to 1 day depending on how many stops you choose to make.
CANADIAN ROCKIES APP BUNDLE
This tour is a part of a set of tour apps by GyPSy Guide to explore the Canadian Rockies National Parks. Other tours in the series include:
*  Banff, Lake Louise and Yoho National Park
*  The Icefields Parkway
*  Jasper National Park
*  And Calgary to Banff (Free)
NOTES
Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.
++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.

Want to explore Cuba your way, with Cuban locals in the lead and without the usual commercial mumbo jumbo? Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!
Why you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba
- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)
- Offline use possible while exploring the island
- Several updates a week with new casas and features
- Even more casas in the app than on our website
- Direct contact with the casa through the app - Save yourself $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly
What are casas particulares?
Cuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!
Online, offline and more
But there is more. Cuba-Junky’s casa particular directory app also works offline, which is great in a country where internet is slow and WiFi networks are rare. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.
No commission: save $5 per night!
By using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!
Some free Cuba advice?
Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.
Why does this app cost about $5?
Just because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead!

The app contains a locally stored database with over 1300 different APN codes for carriers all over the globe. The app will be updated whenever the list is modified.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you find a SIM that does not have a valid APN in the database please email me the settings displayed on the first screen so we can find the correct settings together. I would like the APN list to be as complete as possible, but I will need help from everyone. Please check against the database using the free version first.
I wrote this app for my own travels, so I have a personal desire for it to work whenever I happen to be. I don't want to buy a SIM I can't get the settings for either.
How does this app save money?
Most cell providers charge outrageous fees for international roaming. You can avoid international roaming fees by purchasing a local SIM. In many countries you can get one for less than $10.
In order to do this you need a phone that is not carrier locked (this is not the same as rooting). You can get your phone's unlock code and instructions on how to use it from your carrier. Most of the time you can get this over the phone from your service provider.
Using a local SIM will give you a local phone number. However, If the purchased SIM card includes data getting an internet connection requires the service providers APN settings. This can be difficult to get if you do not speak the local language.
You can learn more about APN settings and how they work here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Point_Name
This app contains a huge database of known APN settings for SIM cards. Run the app and search for your SIM's APN settings. Then you can add these settings automatically, or in the case of Ice Cream Sandwich users copy and paste the individual settings into a new APN entry.
PROFESSIONAL VERSION:
The professional version displays now includes an option for rooted phones to add settings directly to the database rather then having to copy and paste each setting. This version displays the SIM phone number if available, and adds the ability to browse the included APN database by country. This will allow people to check on what APN strings are in the system before travelling to a new destination.
APPLICATION LIMITATIONS:
This application will not give your phone signal where it normally will not get it.
This app will NOT UNLOCK YOUR PHONE. Please stop emailing me asking for an unlock code. :)
My email is provided for support with the application. If you have a SIM card that was not provided with the phone and the application does not have your APN setting please email me. If you have any other issue please contact your service provider.

GyPSy Guide GPS driving tour of Yosemite is an excellent way to enjoy a sightseeing trip to explore the entire National Park. There are 200+ audio points that play automatically, featuring what to see, stories, tips and advice. All the benefits of a guided tour, the freedom to drive yourself.
TOUR GUIDE AS YOU DRIVE AROUND YOSEMITE
If you like driving yourself when you go sightseeing, GyPSy Guide™ tour apps allow you to enjoy a guided tour experience while remaining totally independent. By driving yourself, you'll be able to get from place to place faster, see more things and not be tied to anyone else's schedule.
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST SIGHTS AND STORIES
The tour apps use your device’s location abilities to play the commentary AUTOMATICALLY. All you have to do is drive, listen and decide which places you want to stop at. Our tour guides have created an insightful and entertaining tour of Yosemite. We’ll recommend the best places to experience and some great locations that most visitors will drive by.
PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY
GyPSy Guide knows where you are and which direction you are heading, and plays commentary automatically about the things you are seeing, plus stories and tips and advice.
EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL
It’s just like having a local friend to show you around. And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.
GREAT VALUE
The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.
WORKS OFFLINE
No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data – even visiting from another country.
DRIVING TOUR ROUTE
The tour includes the most popular sightseeing stops and many more:
1) Yosemite Falls
2) Glacier Point
3) Giant Sequoia Groves
4) El Capitan
5) Bridalveil Falls
6) Tioga Road
7) Hetch Hetchy
8) Many other viewpoints and park attractions
GyPSy Guide has commentary on every major road in the Park.
NOTES
Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.
++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style DC outlet car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.
ABOUT US

Enjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience.

None of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit.","b'Just like having a Tour Guide in your Car\xe2\x84\xa2!

Built off the hand written notes of a veteran pilgrim, the app is updated monthly with new content and new features.
This guide covers the two roads from Santiago to the coast, to Finisterre and Muxía. It has been redesigned for Android and now works almost exclusively offline. To use the map features, or to share your comments with other guide owners, will require a data connection. As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.
FEATURES:
Albergue Directory. A full directory of Albergues, and notes on which towns have alternative accommodation like camping, hotels, pensions, and casas rurales.
Stage Guide. Full directory of villages along the way, in the order in which you pass them, with accurate listings of what services are available.
Location Aware. Every location is geo-coded.
Photos. Photos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.
Maps. If you have a data connection, or are connected to wifi, you can view the locations of every point on a map. Unfortunately, this feature is unavailable without a connection.
Scrollable Elevation Map. This one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls South to North. One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.
Comments. Albergue closed early for the season? Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about? Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.

* Offline Augmented Reality in Norway *
See what's near you where you travel in Norway: Mountains, Lakes, Places, Buildings, etc. You don't even have to be nearby Norway: You can manually set your location to a place in Norway to pretend you are there. Decide if you want to see places nearby, or famous cities around the world.
Works everywhere: By the sea, in the mountains, in the city. Without the internet, without coverage.
Turn the phone sideways to view on the camera screen the places that are nearby. Take a picture of what you see, and send it by email, or post it on facebook, directly from the App!
You can also add your own places!
In Sight Norway is also an altimeter, speedometer and also estimates the distance you've traveled. Choose between metric (km, meter) or imperial (miles, feet) units.
All data is built into the App, so you don't need internet. You only need internet when you use the map or send a picture on email or post it on facebook.
Select between the following map types: Standard, Satellite, Hybrid, High Resolution and Sea Map. High resolution maps and sea maps are provided by the Norwegian Mapping Authority.
In Sight Norway relies on the compass and GPS of your device. Best results are achieved if you are outside.
COMPASS CALIBRATION AND ACCURACY.
One way to calibrate the compass is to move the phone in an 8-number manner 3 times: Once when the phone is in landscape, once in portrait and once facing up. Also stay away from magnetic sources that might influence the compass. For the compass to be accurate under usage, you have to be outside to get a good location reading.

Imagine you are on your first trip to Walt Disney World.  You arrive at your hotel (Let’s say the Grand Floridian Resort just for fun), unpack your bags and call your friends who happen to be staying at the Boardwalk Inn.  You decide you want to meet for dinner at the Flying Fish café… but you don’t have a car, and you have no idea how to get to the Boardwalk from the Grand Floridian.  You whip out your phone and the WDW Transportation Wizard comes to your rescue; promptly suggesting several routes involving boats, buses, or monorails.  He even tells you how long it’s likely to take so you won’t be late for dinner.  Thank you Mr Wizard!
Or, perhaps you are a veteran of Disneyworld and love planning daily itineraries.  You plan your trip, making a careful schedule of where to eat and which parks to go to when.  You decide that a fun day at Disney’s Hollywood Studios would really be nicely topped off by dinner at Chefs de France.  But how long is it going to take to get there, and what is the funnest possible route (this is a vacation after all!)?  You pop out your iPhone and fire up the OLP WDW Transportation Wizard who gives you several recommendations.  Oh my gawrsh, I didn’t know you could take a boat from the Studios to Epcot!  That sounds like fun!  But I will have to allow at least 37 minutes for that trip so we better leave by 5PM to make sure we are in time for dinner at 6PM.  Thank you Mr Wizard!

Plus it has detailed information for several other nearby hiking trails!
This App has many innovative features that make it way more useful than a paper guidebook or a website.
The Cape to Cape Track is one of the best kept secrets in the world. If you have a chance to walk the Track, you will not be disappointed!
The App has beautiful photographs, extremely detailed information, built-in maps and GPS support. So you cannot get lost and will not miss anything.
NO INTERNET OR MOBILE COVERAGE IS NEEDED to use this guide. This is very important because most of the track has no mobile coverage. The excellent maps work without using any data, WiFi connection, or internet. So it's fast and won't cost you money.
It's very interactive; turn on your phone or tablet's GPS from within the App, then follow the track and you will never get lost again! Also see exactly where to park to take shorter day hikes, where to get water and food, and where the best sights, beaches and attractions are. Note that GPS works everywhere - you don't need mobile network reception for it to work.
Each map is marked up to show you viewpoints, attractions, toilets, places to get water, the best beaches, where to camp and more. Tap any map marker to show much more information about that place.
It's like having your own personal tour guide in your pocket that is showing you exactly where to turn at those unmarked crossroads, and it can be quickly referenced to show you the name of the beach or town you are on or in. It is easier than using a paper guide book or a paper map and compass because you can instantly see where you are.
We suggest which way you should walk the track and give you the distances between campsites or paid (comfy!) accommodation to help you in planning your hike.
FEATURES:
- We describe beaches, sights, camping, accommodation and more
- We give you lots of useful General Information to help you make your hike enjoyable and safe
- We include a number of useful first-aid tips for the most common issues you may encounter on the Track
- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!
- It has detailed maps of hiking trails. With the phone's GPS enabled you cannot get lost!
- It works without the internet. So there are no data roaming charges. And mobile black spots will not stop the App from working (unlike websites and most other Apps)
- It uses very high-resolution maps.
- It describes several other hiking tracks and day walks nearby the Cape to Cape track.
- You can stream two of our local radio via the internet (when the internet is available)
- All information has been researched and written by a local of the Margaret River region
- Information is presented relative to your current location, so its very easy to find where you are and how far it is to your next camping area or town for that cold beer or chilled glass of white wine
- Has a useful search feature. For example, search for ""shower"" to list everything in the App that uses that text
- Quick reference entries show you all of the water sources and the locations of toilets along the track. Activate the GPS to show you how far to your next one
- The guide is simple to use
- All content is automatically updated from our Cloud server to ensure you have the best, most correct and most up to date information. This happens automatically, infrequently, only when you enable internet connection, and uses very little internet bandwidth","b'This comprehensive guide shows you all you need to know to hike the Cape to Cape Track, which runs from Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin in the Margaret River Region of Western Australia.

GyPSy Guide GPS driving tour of Arches is an excellent way to enjoy a sightseeing trip to explore the national park. There are 70+ audio points that play automatically, featuring what to see, stories, tips and advice. All the benefits of a guided tour, the freedom to drive yourself.
TOUR GUIDE AS YOU DRIVE AROUND ARCHES
If you like driving yourself when you go sightseeing, GyPSy Guide™ tour apps allow you to enjoy a guided tour experience while remaining totally independent. By driving yourself, you'll be able to get from place to place faster, see more things and not be tied to anyone else's schedule.
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE BEST SIGHTS AND STORIES
The tour apps use your device’s location abilities to play the commentary AUTOMATICALLY. All you have to do is drive, listen and decide which places you want to stop at. Our tour guides have created an insightful and entertaining tour of Arches National Park. We’ll recommend the best places to experience and some great locations that most visitors will drive by.
PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY
GyPSy Guide knows where you are and which direction you are heading, and plays commentary automatically about the things you are seeing, plus stories and tips and advice.
EXPLORE LIKE A LOCAL
It’s just like having a local friend to show you around. And that friend just happens to be a professional tour guide.
GREAT VALUE
The same information you would get on a bus tour or from a guide book, for just a fraction of the price. And you control the itinerary and schedule.
WORKS OFFLINE
No data, cellular or even wireless network connection needed while touring. Download over Wi-Fi before you tour.  Anyone can use them with no need for roaming data – even visiting from another country.
DRIVING TOUR ROUTE
The tour includes the most popular sightseeing stops and many more:
1) Park Avenue
2) Balanced Rock
3) Windows
4) Delicate Arch
5) Skyline Arch
6) Devils Garden
7) Landscape Arch
You can join the tour from Moab or anywhere along the route from campgrounds and RV parks. Since you drive in and out of the Park on the same road, there is different commentary on the way out.
NOTES
Download the app on Wi-Fi from your network at home or use any free Wi-Fi network. Because the app is filled with audio commentary and maps, its larger than ""normal"" apps.  Many phone/data networks may block the download because of size - so its important to download over a Wi-Fi network.
++  Continued use of GPS running in the background increases battery usage - we strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger. This is much better than simply plugging into the USB port in a vehicle.

About the John Muir Trail: The John Muir Trail, or JMT, is revered as one of the most pristine and beautiful trails in the world. The 210.5 mile trail makes its way through the heart of the Sierra Nevada Range in Central California. Much of the trail is above 10,000 feet elevation and is quite steep, making this a rather difficult trail. Most hikers hike the JMT southbound, beginning at Happy Isles in Yosemite National Park, and ending at the summit of the highest peak in the ""lower 48"" -- Mt. Whitney. It takes about 2-3 weeks to hike the entire trail (some hikers are faster, some are slower). Many hikers complete the entire trail in one go, and countless others enjoy hiking a few miles along the trail via the many remote side trails that branch off the JMT.

Many hikers complete the entire trail in one go, and countless others enjoy hiking a few miles along the trail via the many remote side trails that branch off the JMT.<br/><br/>Also available:<br/>Guthook\'s Pacific Crest Trail Guide<br/>Guthook\'s Tahoe Rim Trail Guide<br/>Mount Whitney Guide'",,False,₹ 650.00,False,False,AtlasGuides,"April 2, 2017",13M,1000,6.0.18,4.1 and up,['Rated for 3+'],,['Shares Location'],AtlasGuides,support@atlasguides.com,http://atlasguides.com/john-muir-trail/,"2225 N Gemini Rd #E8

Offline Mapping:  Download the maps to your phone while you have an internet connection, and enjoy them while you are on the trail.  The offline maps are designed for the outdoors and are rendered to show the elevation changes along the route.  Map markers include all cities, 900+ accommodation options, notable landmarks along the way, and notices about deviations and alternative routes along the way.  A click on the pin brings up a description of the route, distances, services available in any given place and accommodation details.
Online Booking:  Making reservations for the night is now much easier.  Every city that has a bookable place to sleep includes a direct link on booking.com.  Likewise, every accommodation option that is bookable online includes one as well.  Finding a place to sleep, and finding it on the map, just got a whole lot easier.
Please note that this app requires the additional download of the maps, which are about 200mb in size.  There is no way around this, an offline map is an offline map.
Also, note that this app is in rapid development.  This means that updates to it will be frequent over the next 6-12 months as minor bugs are squashed and features are added.  These updates will NOT require you to re-download the maps.  They will deliver additional content and features.
Please remember that this is version 1 of the 'Wisely' series of Mapping and Booking apps.  Go gentle on the reviews and please please please send me bug reports so that the app can be made better.  You're the best!
