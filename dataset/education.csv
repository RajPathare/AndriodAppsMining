Have you ever said, “I’ll believe it when I see it?” Isn’t that what we usually say when someone tells us something extraordinary? Do we need to see it for ourselves?
Well, guess what? It’s true. You DO only believe what you see, but it’s not only with your physical eyes. You believe only what you see with your inner eyes as well.
What are your inner eyes? It’s the eyes your mind—your imagination. It’s the visual part of your brain that is always creating images and stories that you come to believe whether good or bad. Whether positive or negative. Whether helpful or destructive.
Your beliefs create your reality, and your beliefs are the result of what you see.
Therefore, when you can see something with the eyes of your mind, you’ll believe it. When that happens power is released—your personal power.
Harnessing the Power of Your Mind. The Power of Positive Thinking. Your mind is a powerful tool.
As with any tool, how effective it is depends upon how it is used.
Learning to use the great and amazing power of your thoughts to manifest your life’s purpose and fulfill your goals is a primary reason that many people explore the subject of consciousness.
Napoleon Hill once stated that “goals are dreams with deadlines.” Manifesting your dreams and fulfilling your life’s purpose is an important reason to use the tools and techniques of meditation to harness the power of your mind and make it work for your benefit in your life.
The choice is yours. The time to activate the awesome power of your mind to live the life you have always envisioned is NOW. It is your life and your power to master.
Become the Powerful Person You Are to Get What You Most Want Out of Life
My advice would be to start thinking, really thinking, where it is you would like to be heading and take affirmative action to that end.
Start now! Remember, many people only realize the true value of time after it has gone…!

If you’ve ever dreamed about building a bomber or a modern fighter jet, that doesn’t mean you love war; you just think planes are cool. We understand you completely. All right, are you ready? Go get a piece of paper.
The ‘How to Make Paper Airplanes’ app is simple and easy to use. Follow the step-by-step instructions and watch the 3D animation carefully. And don’t worry, you’d have to try really hard to get confused.
By the way, making paper airplanes, like origami, develops logical reasoning, attention span, spatial thinking and fine motor skills. Consider that when you’re trying to keep your fidgety kids busy.
So, stock up on paper (and a little patience) and take off to the sky!

About Lexia Reading Core5:
Designed as an essential component of every reading curriculum, Lexia Reading Core5 provides personalized learning for students of all abilities in grades pre-K–5, and delivers norm-referenced performance data without interrupting the flow of instruction to administer a test.
Students are automatically placed at the appropriate level and work independently—via Android, browser or desktop client—to develop their foundational reading skills. The program provides immediate corrective feedback and explicit instruction, supporting students when they struggle and advancing them to higher levels as they demonstrate proficiency. Students work in a structured, sequential manner with a focus on:
• Foundational reading skills to develop automaticity and fluency
• Listening and reading comprehension with complex text
• Academic and domain-specific vocabulary to improve comprehension
Each student follows a personalized learning path, with adaptive placement and pacing in activities designed to meet the most rigorous academic standards, including the Common Core State Standards. Based on students’ work in the program, teachers receive data-driven action plans—unique to each student—that are simple to interpret and drive differentiated instruction. Within the first month of use, teachers will know each student's probability of meeting end-of-year, grade-level benchmarks, and will receive the recommended resources and intensity of instruction necessary to change the trajectory for at-risk students. Teachers can focus on instruction—without having to stop to administer a test—by using the program's norm-referenced, embedded assessment and Common Core progress monitoring.

Download the New International Version, a completely new and original translation of the Bible!
Read the most popular Version of the Bible, translated in modern English.
The New International Version (NIV) was created by a group of scholars translating the Bible from the original texts in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.
The project was formally started in a meeting in 1965. A big group of scholars met in Illinois and began to translate the Holy book from available manuscripts in the original languages. The purpose was to create a Bible in contemporary English.
The New International Version Bible was first published in 1973 and it had revisions in 1978 and 1983.
The purpose of New International Version is bring modern Bible readers as close as possible to the original meaning of the Sacred Scriptures.
The work of the NIV will never be complete because English usage is always changing. The CBT (Committee of Bible Translation) is charged to meet every year to review and maintain the NIV. A 2011 update is the latest revision.
The New International Version consists of 39 books in the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi) and 27 books in the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Corinthians 1 and 2, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation)
Listening to the Bible is an incredible experience. After all, the words were meant to be heard, not necessarily only read. It can also help you learn better.

The scriptures included are for the 2019 quiz season covering verses from Bible Doctrine.
Select a verse within the app to memorize.  The entire verse will be initially displayed.  Read the verse then click the > button to advance to the next step, which will display the verse with a few letters removed.  Read the verse again, and you will notice that you are able to successfully recall/read the verse even though some letters are missing.  Your brain is familiar enough with the verse to fill in the missing parts successfully.  Each time the > button is clicked, more letters will be removed from the verse until eventually all you will see is a blank screen.  At each step, try to quote the verse to yourself.  If you need to make sure you are recalling the verse correctly, you may click the Toggle button which will display the entire verse again.  By the time you advance to the blank screen you should be able to quote the entire verse from memory.
The audio record capability allows quizzers to record themselves quoting a verse and then check themselves for correction by listening to the recorded verse.
The study verse screen also includes buttons to show quizzers the unique verse beginning, unique verse ending, 1x words, 2x words, and 3x words for the verse being studied.  For 2x and 3x words, the references to other verses contain those words are also displayed, and the quizzer can toggle between those verses to see the context of all of the 2x and 3x words.  If this verse contains the last occurrence of a 2x or 3x word, the 2x or 3x button appears green notifying the quizzer that it is a last occurrence.
Traditionally, Bible Quizzers have memorized verses by studying a flashcard, flipping it over to hide the verse, then flipping it back over again to make sure the verse was recalled correctly.  This technique of showing and hiding the verse in its entirety is now replaced with a new technique of gradually removing parts until verse recall is achieved with no visual clues.  This new memorization technique is faster and more effective than traditional flash card study.
Quizzers are also able to practice verse beginnings, verse endings, unique words, 2x words, and 3x words. By practicing verse beginnings, a quizzer's referencing skills will improve. The quizzer will be shown a verse beginning and will have to think of the reference, or will be shown a reference and will have to think of the verse beginning. For unique word, 2x word, and 3x word practice, the quizzer will be shown a unique, 2x, or 3x word and will have to think of the reference(s) for the verse(s) containing that information.  Additionally, quizzers can practice missed verse beginnings from BQQuote sessions.  A timer can be set for these practice drills, encouraging quizzers to speed up their recall.  Also, a summary of correct and missed items is available throughout each practice drill by clicking the statistics button.
The app also includes a “List All Verses” selection that will list all verses within a given range.  Within the listing the unique verse beginnings, verse endings, 1x words, 2x words, and 3x words can be highlighted.

Forget about boring music note flashcards. Flashnote Derby is the fun way for kids to learn music notes and practice memorizing them. Learning to read music is key to laying the groundwork for future success. Flashnote Derby actually makes this enjoyable and helps students stay motivated in their music studies.
Each race is a music drill in which you identify different notes as they appear on each flashcard. Answering quickly and correctly will cause your horse to gain ground, while incorrect answers will cause you to fall behind. At the end of each race, you can review the notes you missed and see the correct answers.
The game is fully customizable to allow for any desired notes in the treble clef or bass clef to be included. You select exactly which notes are drilled so it's easy to focus on specific areas that need work. The amount of time the given for each music flashcard can be increased or decreased depending upon their age and experience.
Drills can start out simply, with only a handful of notes used, and gradually be made more challenging until the full staff is mastered (up to five ledger lines above or below the staff.) The more difficult the settings, the more points are awarded. The 'high score' is tracked so that players always have a goal to strive for.
As a bonus, over a dozen instructional video lessons are easily accessible from right inside the app! Even children with no prior music instruction or note reading experience can start using Flashnote Derby right away to begin learning about the music alphabet, the staff, and how to identify different notes.
Because it can be set up so quickly, Flashnote Derby provides a perfect motivational tool for music teachers to use with students, even for just a minute or two of each lesson.
Sometimes it takes only a little extra effort to make the difference between success and failure. Piano students, band and orchestra students, singers, guitar players- this is the app for you! Download Flashnote Derby and learn to read music today!

DragonBox Numbers will teach your child what numbers are, how they work, and what you can do with them. The game makes it easy and fun for your child to gain an intuitive understanding of numbers. It's a great introduction to the wonderful world of math.
DragonBox Numbers brings math to life by turning numbers into colorful and relatable characters, called Nooms. The Nooms can be stacked, sliced, combined, sorted, compared and played with, any way your child pleases.
The app contains 4 different activites for your child to explore, each designed to challenge your child to use the Nooms and basic math in a different way.
The ""Sandbox"" section of the game is designed to let your child explore and experiment with the Nooms. It's also the perfect tool for parents and teachers to explain basic math concepts to kids.
In the ""Puzzle"" section, your child will use basic math to create their own puzzle pieces, and place them in the right spot to reveal a hidden picture. Every move your child makes reinforces number sense. Your child will perform thousands of operations while solving the 250 puzzles.
In the ""Ladder"" section, your child will have to think strategically to build larger numbers. Your child will develop an intuitive understanding of how larger numbers relate to small numbers, and practice basic math strategies every step of the way.
In the ""Run"" section, your child will have to direct the Noom down a path using quick mental calculations. Your child can use their fingers, Nooms or numerals to jump over obstacles. This activity reinforces your child's number sense and trains their ability to quickly recognise and add numbers.
DragonBox Numbers is based on the same pedagogical principles as the other games in the award-winning DragonBox series, and works by integrating the learning seamlessly into the gameplay, no quizzes or mindless repetitions. Every interaction in DragonBox Numbers is designed to heighten your child’s understanding of numbers and strengthen his or her love of math, giving your child a great foundation for future math learning.","b'Give your child the foundation they need for future math learning with DragonBox Numbers.<br/><br/>DragonBox Numbers will teach your child what numbers are, how they work, and what you can do with them.

Features:
• Offline C/C++ compiler: create your own applications on Android device and run them even without Internet access
• Qt, SDL, SDL2, Allegro, SFML, FLTK and NativeActivity support for graphics
• Export & share your programs as APK or binaries
• Debugger with breakpoints and watches
• CMake and Makefile support: use the same build scripts as on your PC (BusyBox is included)
• Source code editor with syntax highlighting, tabs, code completion, code formatting, file association and undo/redo
• No root required (but C4droid can use it for your programs if you want)
• Full ANSI C and ISO C99 support with TCC (Tiny C Compiler) + musl libc
• Fully-functional C++ compiler, complete C++11 support with GCC
• Git integration
• Customizable GUI, choose where to place tabs and buttons by yourself, themes are also supported
• Semi-automatic open-source library porting feature for enhanced programming & education
C4droid is designed to be user-friendy out-of-the-box, but nothing is perfect, so here are some answers for questions that can appear:
How to use Makefiles, multifile projects, etc?
Long-click compile button (or select ""compilation settings"" if buttons are hidden/moved) and configure current directory to use the mode you want.
Note that C4droid will create .c4droid configuration file when you press Ok. Some modes (like makefile) require to enter result executable file name, don't forget to do that.
After doing that all use compile and run buttons to build and run your app as regular.
How to use graphics libraries in single-file mode?
Just install SDL plugin and select G++ compiler in C4droid preferences.
Note that C4droid chooses app mode using a very simple source code analysis:
every graphics mode is detected with corresponding include string (e.g. SDL is detected with #include ""SDL.h"", check bundled examples for more info). Commenting out these lines will
not
have any effect.
If you are compiling a single-file Qt app, you should also add #include ""yoursourcefilenamewithcpp.moc"" to the end of source code file also.
How to install C++ support manually?
C4droid will ask you to install C++ support at first startup and will configure itself in semi-automatic mode.
If you want to do that manually, you need:
0) Enough (100MB) internal memory OR root rights
1) Install GCC plugin
2) Select G++ compiler in C4droid preferences
Note that if you want to use C4droid as a C compiler, it is better to select GCC, not G++.
How to build and install libraries?

DragonBox Algebra 5+ Is perfect for giving young children a head start in mathematics and algebra. Children as young as five can easily begin to grasp the basic processes involved in solving linear equations without even realising that they are learning. The game is intuitive, engaging and fun, allowing anyone to learn the basics of algebra at his or her own pace.
DragonBox Algebra 5+ covers the following algebraic concepts:
* Addition
* Division
* Multiplication
Suitable from age five and up, DragonBox Algebra 5+ gives young learners the opportunity to get familiar with the basics of equation solving.
DragonBox uses a novel pedagogical method based on discovery and experimentation. Players learn how to solve equations in a playful and colorfull game environment where they are encouraged to experiment and be creative. By manipulating cards and trying to isolate the DragonBox on one side of the game board, the player gradually learns the operations required to isolate X on one side of an equation. Little by little, the cards are replaced with numbers and variables, revealing the addition, division and multiplication operators the player has been learning throughout the game.
Playing does not require supervision, although parents can assist them in transferring learned skills into pen and paper equation solving. It is a great game for parents to play with their kids and can even give them an opportunity to freshen up their own math skills.
DragonBox was developed by former math teacher Jean-Baptiste Huynh and has been heralded as a perfect example of game-based learning. As a result, it is currently forming the basis of an extensive research project by the Center For Game Science at the University of Washington.
Features
* 10 progressive chapters (5 learning, 5 training)
* 200 puzzles
* Learn to solve equations involving addition, subtraction, division and multiplication
* Multiple profiles
* Dedicated graphics and music for each chapter

Get it here at: https://gumroad.com/l/FhCqo
As I approached my senior year for my B.S. in Electrical Engineering, I wanted to create
something that most people hadn't created before, a circuit simulator! It was about the
experience, the learning, and the the journey itself. I put together this application to
package my knowledge in Electrical Engineering to some day help another student have
an easier time in their scholastic pursuits and in turn teach them about circuits.
Circuit Solver is far from perfect and there are lots of things that could be optimized.
It will however, simulate a majority of linear Circuits and a decent amount of smaller
scale Non-Linear Circuits. If this app helps you in any way, i'd appreciate you spreading
the word to help support my efforts, Thanks!
Think of Circuit Solver as an electronic circuit board, you drag your electrical components
and place them on one at a time. You hook up some sources and you place some meters
to read the values. If you need to analyze the waveform, grab some electrical leads and
view them with an oscilloscope. There are many SPICE tools out there for PC such as
Multisim, LTSpice, and PSpice. Circuit Solver doesn't compare to their raw power
but it is optimized to run on mobile devices which makes it both portable and easily
accessible to anyone in need of circuit solutions. Circuit Solver strives to verify Ohm's law,
Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws by creating models that are both stable and efficient.
Make circuit solver your first step in circuit design!
DC Simulation:
To simulate the circuits, a matrix is defined based on all the components inside the circuit.
The application solves the circuit using matrix manipulations such as LU-Decomposition
and matrix inversion. DC Analysis is completed by writing a series of nodal equations.
The equations are solved simultaneously to obtain a unique solution.
Transient Simulation:
In transient simulation we use numerical integration to determine the response of RLC
circuits. Numerical integration allows for one to solve for discrete moments of time and
in effect integrate their response. This application only supports the Backward Euler method.
Non Linear Simulation:
Non linear simulation is used for components such as diodes, LEDs, and transistors.
The solver first guesses the approximate value of the solution and is refined through the
use of a Newton-Raphson process. It utilizes linear approximation to predict the answer
through successive iterations.
Built-in-Oscilloscope:
Visualize waveforms through the use of the built in oscilloscope. To use this feature
simply link either a volt meter or an amp meter to the graph by tapping on them and
pressing the eye, in order to view the wave.
Saving Schematics/Circuits:
Save your circuits on your device to use anywhere you go and at any time. You may
also capture screen shots of the circuits you build. These screen shots are saved
locally on your device.

GENKI Kanji Cards,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3Jh8fBQSclVFM3IzsqOSrb0yx_AAP-8TDTWhau3JGX-KXmGnecxS6gC3CnHhnlM8mpHO,5,,['EDUCATION'],3.7,"{5: 15, 4: 4, 3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 6}",30,"Learn basic kanji through kanji words:
GENKI Kanji Cards is a digital card app that helps users become able to recognize 317 basic kanji by studying more than 1,100 kanji words at their own pace!
This is the second official app to be released for “GENKI: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese,” a best-selling series of Japanese learning materials boasting more than 1.2 million copies sold.
Advantages
◆ Users can view the cards as they like, enabling them to study at their own pace.
◆ By repeating a process of memorization and self-checking, learners can master readings of kanji words and recognition of basic kanji.
◆ Cards already mastered are progressively removed from the card deck, so users can concentrate on just the kanji that challenge them, making for a more efficient approach to learning.
Study methods and functions
◇ “MyDeck” allows users to view the cards over and over, so they can take their time learning.
・Users memorize the kanji by freely displaying or hiding each card’s kanji word or reading.
・The cards in MyDeck can be shuffled.
・Basic information on the target kanji is provided on the back of each card.
・Fun illustrations and mnemonic hints help users to better retain the kanji studied.
(The illustrations and hints are taken from the very popular learning resource “Kanji Look and Learn.”)
・The stroke order of each kanji is shown with animation.
◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.
・Users check their understanding of the cards studied and sort them into those mastered and those not yet retained.
・Retention can be checked by going from Reading to Kanji, or vice-versa.
・The cards already mastered are taken out of the set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.
◇ “List” displays a list of all the words and kanji covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review them.
・In the lists arranged in lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, or alphabetical order, checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered. The cards can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.
・Kanji information on the cards can be displayed from the entries in the On/Kun list.
○This app is based on the kanji and kanji words learned in the second edition of GENKI.
○It functions the same as the iPhone version of GENKI Kanji Cards.
○The stroke order animations may not run properly on some devices/platforms. If this occurs, try restarting your device.
○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning.
○GENKI Vocab Cards, another Android app based on the GENKI textbook, is also available.

Hello everyone! Are you up to an adventure? I am Abby the Monkey, the friend you know from a highly-successful application series by 22learn, and I have prepared one for you! If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!!
But first let me tell you a story….
******************************************
Once upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten.
The legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space.
All that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure!
******************************************
But, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost!
And now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me?

The popular speed reading app is finally available on Android!
- Significant increases in your reading speed
- Eye-exercises and improvements in your mental capacity
This speed reading app provides everything you need to read texts of all types faster, more effectively and most of all, with better retention.
The PowerReader allows you to get your daily work done while practicing important reading skills.
Learning reading techniques has never been this much fun!
Double your reading speed in just a few days.
Trial users have used this software to increase their reading speed by an average of 143% in 10 days.
Do you currently need 30 minutes to read the daily paper? Soon you will read two papers and, in addition, another chapter in an interesting non-fiction book – within the same time period.
This innovative app provides the ideal platform to achieve measurable results with a minimum of effort.
But that’s not all: You will have fun mastering the skills you need to attain effective reading techniques and significantly increase your reading speed; this means:
- Rapid recognition of numbers, letters and words
- Flexible eye movements
- Improved ability to concentrate
- Increased vision span
The app guides you through the individual training steps.
The software immediately recognizes your strengths and weaknesses. The statistics function lets you see and track your progress.
The results of each training exercise are charted for your review. More stars mean that you are getting closer to your objective: more effective reading skills and with it extremely high reading speeds.
You can check your reading speed at any time using different reading tests from a variety of topics.
Questions about the text are used as a secondary test to assess your retention ability. This is the ideal combination for mastering effective reading skills and high retention rates.
But beware: you might get hooked since early progress will motivate you to work on your skills regularly.
It is fun and you are doing something to stay mentally fit at the same time.
We recommend that you train regularly but not excessively to ensure best results.
Who needs this app?
- Anyone reading more than half an hour a day
- Executives
- Secretaries
- High-School and College students
- Purchasing and Sales Professionals
Who can benefit from this app?
- Do you often feel that you take too long to read something?
- Do you return to previous passages because something was not clear?
- Are you easily distracted while reading?
- Do you have difficulty recalling what you read?
If you answered ‘Yes’ to any of these questions then this app is what you need.","b'Reading Trainer improves your reading speed and retention rate with 12 challenging and fun exercises.

THE MISSION
Have a blast navigating your Thinkrolls through a series of obstacles in brightly patterned mazes. The goal is to solve the puzzles and reach the end of the maze where a new Thinkroll waits to be unlocked and lead the next quest!
HOW TO PLAY
The app offers 207 clever puzzle levels. Seven fun elements with unique physical properties are gradually introduced. Kids will discover through hands-on manipulation how to use these objects to their advantage and clear a path.
• Cookies • Munch them to clear a path or resist those treats to avoid getting trapped!
• Crates • Push them to fill gaps or stack them to reach higher ground.
• Balloons • Burst them on spikes to get them out of your way.
• Rocks • Get a crash course in Newtonian physics by dropping heavy, dense boulders to break through cracked ground.
• Jelly • Bounce Thinkrolls and objects on springy jellies to launch them up.
• Fire • Use ice blocks to put out the fire and safely pass through.
• Elevators • Timing is added to the mix! Synchronize movements of two different elevators to navigate through the maze.
Little players will master the art of thinking while using to their advantage force, acceleration, buoyancy, heat, elasticity and gravity to reach the end of the maze. The puzzles gradually build upon successive lessons to strengthen observation, creative thinking, logic, problem solving, spatial cognition and memory.
There's no failure here. There are unlimited tries and no penalties. As kids try different combinations to achieve their goal, they intuitively learn through trial and error what works. They must think ahead, use precise timing and rely on their memory to reunite their Thinkroll buddies.

Every time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.
The Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.

""Both beautiful and slightly disturbing"" – Business Insider
""the sight of this invisible world is breathtaking"" – Gizmodo
""an entirely new lens through which to view the [reality] we have, but rely on every day."" – Boston Globe
""Fascinating."" – NYTimes.com
Why should I use this app?
Out of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works?
The purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.
Why Should I not use this app?
This app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.
So how does it work?
The Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.
Is this really what radio signals look like?
We can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.
The Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it.","b'The infosphere, Visualized.<br/><br/>Every time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals.

It includes over 800 multiple choice questions, almost 600 flashcards, 28 scenarios, 24 medication calculations, and 47 ECG's!
MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!  We are so convinced that you will love our app, we will refund any purchases within 3 days of download if you are unsatisfied.
This app was created by practicing paramedics who have direct experience providing patient care, teaching other paramedics, and taking high stakes exams like the NREMT-P (NRP). The goal of this app is to have a resource where paramedics can come to learn new information, review tricky material, or take a look at real life EKG’s. Paramedic Tutor comes with several ways to interact with the material to enhance learning. There are multiple choice questions, flashcards, scenarios, and an EKG quiz. Throughout the app, special attention has been paid to Airway, Cardiology, Pediatrics, OBGYN, and EKG’s. These are the areas that are tested most often on national exams, because these patient types can be rare. The questions are not designed to trick, but they are designed around the best answer. Weather you are brushing up on skills, taking the NREMT-P (NRP), or taking a job-placement exam, this app can help you. Enjoy!
This app has some features that we think are pretty cool:
Bookmarking:While taking a quiz or looking at flashcards, we offer the ability to bookmark a question or flashcard for later review. If you find that you are repeatedly missing a certain question or if you are unaware of the reason for an answer, you have the ability to bookmark the question and later review it for a more effective learning experience.
Explanations: Learning is the end result that we hope to produce. To provide our students with an optimal learning experience, we provide detailed explanations for why certain answers are correct, as well as descriptions of why other answers are incorrect.
DISCLAIMER:Unfortunately, we are not without our mistakes. While we promise to continually hone and refine the material in this app, there may still be errors. While in the field, you should rely on your training and on the protocols and procedures under which you work.
We hope that you enjoy the experience of the Paramedic Tutor. If you have material that you think would help others pass the NREMT-P (NRP) or excel on the job, our content writers are always willing to review any material. If you find an error, please contact us with your thoughts and we will certainly review it.

The secret path to language learning
Remember the American English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of American English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.
This is how the future of language courses looks like
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn American English phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.
Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
Learn the right American English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your American English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak American English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.
Useful phrases for real situations.
Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning American English. Mondly teaches you American English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.
Learn conversational American English.
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core American English vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak American English clearly.
Verb conjugations.
If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the American English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.
Advanced Statistics.
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.
The Leaderboard.
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.
Adaptive Learning.
Learning American English is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.

Build any circuit, tap play button, and watch dynamic voltage, current, and charge animations. This gives you insight into circuit operation like no equation does. While simulation is running, adjust circuit parameters with analog knob, and the circuit responds to your actions in real time. You can even generate an arbitrary input signal with your finger!
That's interactivity and innovation you can't find in best SPICE tools for PC like Multisim, LTspice, OrCad or PSpice (trademarks belong to their respective owners).
EveryCircuit is not just an eye candy. Under the hood it packs custom-built simulation engine optimized for interactive mobile use, serious numerical methods, and realistic device models. In short, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, nonlinear semiconductor device equations, and all the good stuff is there.
Growing library of components gives you freedom to design any analog or digital circuit from a simple voltage divider to transistor-level masterpiece.
Schematic editor features automatic wire routing, and minimalistic user interface. No nonsense, less tapping, more productivity.
Simplicity, innovation, and power, combined with mobility, make EveryCircuit a must-have companion for high school science and physics students, electrical engineering college students, breadboard and printed circuit board (PCB) enthusiasts, and ham radio hobbyists.

The secret path to language learning
Remember the Russian language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Russian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.
This is how the future of language courses looks like
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Russian phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.
Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
Learn the right Russian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Russian words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Russian clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.
Useful phrases for real situations.
Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Russian. Mondly teaches you Russian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.
Learn conversational Russian.
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Russian vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Russian clearly.
Verb conjugations.
If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Russian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.
Advanced Statistics.
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.
The Leaderboard.
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.
Adaptive Learning.
Learning Russian is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.
Before you know it, at the end of these Russian lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","b'Learn Russian with free lessons daily.

Care for your very own Very Hungry Caterpillar, a tamagotchi style virtual pet based on the best-selling picture book!
Eric Carle’s much-loved character, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, has won the hearts of millions of children around the world for more than 45 years. Now, for the first time, The Very Hungry Caterpillar is brought to life in a stunning educational 3D interactive app.
My Very Hungry Caterpillar will captivate you as he crawls across the screen! Have fun playing and learning together. Feed him, draw with him, pick him up, or take a peek into his colorful toy box. Help him explore nature - pick fruits from trees, play in the pond and grow beautiful flowers.
You'll soon fall in love with your own adorable Very Hungry Caterpillar as you enjoy a range of fun activities together. Hatch him from an egg, drag tasty fruits from a nearby tree, then watch as he eats them! And when My Very Hungry Caterpillar gets sleepy, just tuck him into his bed.
Each time you wake him up, it’s time for an exciting new adventure: push him on a swing, sail on a pond with bobbing Rubber Ducks, and grow flowers and fruit in a magical 3D garden.
The more you play, the more surprises you'll find including new activities, new fruit, and new toys unlocked over time. Chase a bouncing ball, pop floating bubbles and watch out for the wind-up Grouchy Ladybug!
Day by day, My Very Hungry Caterpillar grows bigger and bigger, until he changes into a beautiful butterfly. Then a new egg is laid and the adventure begins again.
It's a world of beauty and color you'll return to again and again.

The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.

The secret path to language learning
Remember the Korean language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Korean grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.
This is how the future of language courses looks like
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Korean phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.
Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
Learn the right Korean pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Korean words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Korean clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.
Useful phrases for real situations.
Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Korean. Mondly teaches you Korean vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.
Learn conversational Korean.
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Korean vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Korean clearly.
Verb conjugations.
If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Korean verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.
Advanced Statistics.
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.
The Leaderboard.
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.
Adaptive Learning.
Learning Korean is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.
Before you know it, at the end of these Korean lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","b'Learn Korean with free lessons daily.

WHERE DID LINGVIST COME FROM?
Our founder, Mait, started Lingvist while working as a nuclear physicist at CERN in Switzerland. He'd lived in the French-speaking part of the country for years and wanted to expand his social life, but he always found conventional methods a little unengaging and too slow for his liking. He needed a better way to learn French – so, he created a prototype, began learning French, took a high-school language exam, and passed with a strong grade.
Today’s Lingvist is the result of that original idea and its basic principles – and we’ve come a long way since then. Founded in Estonia, we now have over 1 million users and a super-talented and friendly team across offices in Tallinn, London, Berlin, and Tokyo.
We believe anyone can learn a language in a fast and effective way.
Happy learning!

EXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM
The four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop!

TURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD
Plant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!
CREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY
Use the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!
FEATURES:

THE FOREST: Ready to frolic in the forest? Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.
THE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.
TRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS
Each location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there.

Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core Vietnamese words and Vietnamese phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. If you want to learn beyond the basics, there are also Vietnamese grammar lessons available. It’s even great for kids!
With Mondly you can learn Vietnamese sentences and expressions FREE with daily Vietnamese language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.
The secret path to language learning
Remember the Vietnamese language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Vietnamese grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.
This is how the future of language courses looks like
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Vietnamese phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.
Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
Learn the right Vietnamese pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.
- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Vietnamese words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Vietnamese clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.
- Useful phrases for real situations.
Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Vietnamese. Mondly teaches you Vietnamese vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.
- Learn conversational Vietnamese.
Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Vietnamese vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Vietnamese clearly.
- Verb conjugations.
Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Vietnamese verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.
- Statistics that make sense.
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.
- The Leaderboard.
We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.
- Adaptive Learning.
We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner’s needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Vietnamese is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.
Before you know it, at the end of these Vietnamese lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.","b'Learn Vietnamese with 5 minutes of practice daily.

The secret path to language learning
Remember the Romanian language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Romanian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.
This is how the future of language courses looks like
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Romanian phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.
Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
Learn the right Romanian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Romanian words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Romanian clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.
Useful phrases for real situations.
Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Romanian. Mondly teaches you Romanian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.
Learn conversational Romanian.
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Romanian vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Romanian clearly.
Verb conjugations.
If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Romanian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.
Advanced Statistics.
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.
The Leaderboard.
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

Learning Romanian is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.

The secret path to language learning
Remember the Finnish language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Finnish grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.
This is how the future of language courses looks like
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Finnish phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.
Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:
Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.
Learn the right Finnish pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.
State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.
Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Finnish words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Finnish clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.
Useful phrases for real situations.
Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Finnish. Mondly teaches you Finnish vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.
Learn conversational Finnish.
Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Finnish vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Finnish clearly.
Verb conjugations.
If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Finnish verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.
Advanced Statistics.
The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.
The Leaderboard.
See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.
Adaptive Learning.
Learning Finnish is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.
Before you know it, at the end of these Finnish lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","b'Learn Finnish with free lessons daily.

It is visible in a 24/7 live video streaming!
If you like space or astronomy, you will like the ISS HD live app.
ISS HD live will show you a
live video feed of the Earth
from International Space Station directly on your android phone or tablet. ISS HD live offers you an exciting experience where everything is thoroughly thought and designed, the complete app that shows
Earth video streaming
about 400 km above it, with a lot of options fully customizable.
You will have available a stunning
live HD video streaming
to your device screen, directly from the
International Space Station cameras.
The app has integrated the native Android Google Map (ISS tracker) in it, where you can follow the ISS orbit around our planet, zoom, rotate, drag, tilt the map. Also, you can choose between different types of map, like Satellite or Terrain, and an information window is also presented with data such as ISS speed, altitude, visibility, country above which ISS is right now, latitude and longitude. Everything is customizable from settings menu.
You have seven different source of live video streaming:
1. Live HD camera
- a wonderful HD video streaming view of our planet
2. Live Standard camera
- this is not HD, but it shows a live streaming of the Earth and from time to time details of the ISS, like tests, maintenance and communication with Earth
3. NASA TV
- is the television service of the United States government agency NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).
4. NASA TV Media.
5. Spacewalk (Recorded)
- Beautiful HD images from cameras of astronauts outside the ISS.
6. Inside the International Space Station
- Take a video tour of each module inside the ISS, all explained by the astronauts.
7. Eventual Channel
- Temporary live cameras from NASA, European Space Agency (ESA) and Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos)
You can watch these live feeds in your televisor using
Google Cast
You will be
notified
when next sunset or sunrise will occur allowing you to watch it live directly from International Space Station.
Do you want to see the ISS in the sky at night?
This is the easiest way to spot the station. With the built-in ISS detector tool, ISS HD Live will tell you when and where to look for the International Space Station. You get an alarm a few minutes before a pass. And you will get a notification when it will pass over your region during the daylight. By this way, you can admire your country from space.
You will be also notified when special events, such as spacewalk will occur.
Explore the International Space Station with
Google Street View
Aspiring astronauts can now pretend to float on the International Space Station (ISS), thanks to Google. The company worked with astronauts on the orbiting complex to provide a Google Street View of the low orbit satellite, from its science labs to its beautiful Earth-facing Cupola window.
Note:
When ISS (International Space Station) is on the night side of Earth, the video image is black, which is normal.
Sometimes video is not available due to transmission issues or when the crew is changing cameras. In such cases, usually you will have a blue or a blank screen. In few minutes the transmission should return, so, please be patient. This is not an app issue.

It’s all customizable to meet your unique needs.

Budget Challenge® is an award-winning and patented program that actually SHOWS young people how to manage money in a real life setting.  We use a Learning-By-Doing approach to put students in the driver’s seat in our Road Test for Personal Finance®.  Our contest simulations are 10 weeks in duration and students receive paychecks and bills in real time and are challenged to pay their bills and save money for retirement in a 401k.  Unlike other simulations, Budget Challenge is also a competition that scores and ranks students based on how well they save, answer weekly quizzes, and manage their financial responsibilities (pay bills).  Students can compete with other students in their class and classes can compete with other classes based on class average to make the learning of life skills engaging and fun.
The simulation does not use real money, but is extremely realistic including features such as online bill pay, direct deposit, email bill alerts, 401k paycheck deductions and more.  Budget Challenge also includes many of the complicated banking and credit card fees that plague young people in the real world, so students can learn the ropes and make their costly ‘rookie’ mistakes in the safety of the classroom.
Budget Challenge aims to make students Real World Ready by focusing on Behaviors, Knowledge, and Skills.  Our program aligns with NCEE and Jump$tart national standards and goes well beyond teaching vocabulary and financial concepts by putting these topics into action with real consequences.  This patented product delivers unparalleled results that really matter for students entering the real world.    The statistics below were from a study of over 25,000 students and were published on Time.com:
•	92% said learning about money management was very important and 80% wanted to learn more
•	92% said they were more likely to check their account balance before writing a check
•	89% said they were more confident and 91% said they were more aware of money pitfalls and mistakes
•	87% said they were better able to avoid bank and credit card fees
•	84% said they were better able to understand fine print and 79% said they were better able to compare financial products
•	78% said they learned money management methods that worked best for them
•	53% said they were rethinking their college major or career choice with an eye toward higher pay
While most of the core functionality of the website is contained in this app, there are limitations of small screens, so some content has been abridged or removed from the app.  For first time users, we recommend playing the simulation for a week or two on a PC/Mac before using the app exclusively.

How would you place them in orbit? If you are interested in Astronomy and looking for a powerful yet easy to use 3D universe sandbox app to create and simulate a whole new galaxy with realistic physics and gravity rules, then you’ve come to the right place. Pocket Universe, the 3D gravity sandbox game, provides you the ultimate power to explore the infinite space and simulate your own space full of different planets, gas giants, and stars. In this gravity simulator app, you get to customize literally any aspect of these particles to simulate and design your very own pocket universe sandbox. Once you are satisfied with your customized solar system (or any other combination of particles, planets, and stars), you get to easily add it to your collection, take a screenshot and share it with the world. Pocket Universe comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won’t feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It’s just fascinating. Is Pocket Universe Easy to Use? Is this 3D universe sandbox with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you’ll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket universes with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you’ll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc, and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. Tip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level.

Pocket Universe comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It\xe2\x80\x99s just fascinating. Is Pocket Universe Easy to Use? Is this 3D universe sandbox with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket universes with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc, and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. Tip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level. <br/><br/><u>Product features</u><br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tSimple: Point your device at the sky to identify galaxies, stars, constellations, planets, and satellites (including the ISS and Hubble) passing overhead at your location.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tAugmented Reality (AR): Use your camera to spot objects in the sky, day or night.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tSocial: Capture and share beautiful images with friends and family on social networks.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tSupports Space NavigatorTM binoculars, spotting scope, and telescopes.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe most beautiful universe sandbox game available on mobile devices.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tMassive variation of procedural planets, gas giants and stars.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tName your creations or use the unique random name generator.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\t3D graphics that are out of this world.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tBlack hole with realistic gravity lensing effect.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tFeatures all the planets from our solar system which are unlocked everyday.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tShare epic screenshots of your pocket universe with friends.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe ultimate gravity sandbox game for those who love space simulators.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tIllustrating the phase of the moon with a picture<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tPercentage of the visible moonarea<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tlist of upcoming full- &amp; newmoons<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tjourney through time - in the past and future<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tno permission needed<br/><i>Technical details</i><br/>Size:\xc2\xa0Varies by device (39.9MB - 45.6MB)<br/>Version:\xc2\xa0Varies by device<br/>Application Permissions<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tAccess fine (e.g., GPS) location<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tAccess coarse (e.g., Cell-ID, Wi-Fi) location<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tOpen network sockets<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tDiscover and pair bluetooth devices<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tAccess information about networks<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tRequired to be able to access the camera device<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tConnect to paired bluetooth devices<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tRead from external storage<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tGet notified that the operating system has finished booting<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2\tWrite to external storage<br/>Minimum Operating System:\xc2\xa0Android 4.0.3'",,False,0,True,False,Zeeapplic,"September 14, 2018",10M,1000,1.0,4.1 and up,['Rated for 3+'],,,Zeeapplic,zeeapplic@gmail.com,https://sites.google.com/view/appgament,,com.sky.map.zeeapplic.moonphases,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sky.map.zeeapplic.moonphases

Ureka is the future of science. It is a mobile platform for scientists to share their results in real-time, bypassing the long processes scientists often must undergo before their scientific results are shared. Ureka also serves as a hub for critique and collaboration at a global scale; we can greatly reduce the amount of time, energy, and funds spent on misguided science by increasing the number of people reviewing the research. With Ureka, science can evolve and excel exponentially -- the way it is meant to.
Who is it for?
Ureka is designed for both scientists and the general public. This extends from MDs who don’t have access to publications and need to learn about current findings in the medical industry, to graduate students who have to rifle through hundreds of papers per day just to determine which publication contains the most current, relevant, and robust research results. Ureka will keep both academics and science enthusiasts abreast of the current trends in science inside a collaborative, user-friendly mobile platform.
What are the key features?
Ureka combines all of the best features of Instagram, Twitter, Slack, Linked-In, AcademicJobs, and more. Key features and capabilities include: post an image and description of the results to relevant science channels; subscribe and follow scientific channels specific to your interests to see the latest results in that research area; all channels have a trending feed and a time-dependent feed, so you can see the most recent and/or the most active posts; measurable in-app metrics that track user impact and activity, which can be used in the future for hiring practices and in-app awards. Future versions will include job hunting tools, conference support, private sub-channels, and animated posts.
How much does it cost?
Ureka is FREE. We believe that science should be open to everyone, but the current publishing schema is a crime against humanity. Taxpayer funds are pumped into institutions to fund scientific progress. Scientists then give their work away for free (or sometimes even at a cost) to publishers, who in turn make a large profit by hiding those results behind paywalls that cost readers hundreds to thousands of dollars per paper. Ureka will remove the proverbial middleman and provide the same services (and more) at no cost to the user.","b'What is Ureka?<br/><br/>Ureka is the future of science.

Darknet DEEP WEB...
This is but a tiny corner of the internet, and the Dark Web and the Deep Web loom in much shadier corners. Using Tor you can access them, but should you even want to visit the Dark Web or the Deep Web?
Let's take a tour to help you make up your mind.
What is the Darknet Dark Web?
The DarkWeb is a term that refers specifically to a collection of websites that exist on an encrypted network and cannot be found by using traditional search engines or visited by using traditional browsers.
Almost all sites on the so-called Darknet DarkWeb hide their identity using the Tor encryption tool. You may know Tor for its ability to hide your identity and activity. You can use Tor to spoof your location so it appears you're in a different country to where you're really located, making it much like using a VPN service.
When a website is run through Darknet Tor it has much the same effect.
Indeed, it multiplies the effect. To visit a site on the Darknet that is using Tor encryption, the web user needs to be using Tor. Just as the end user's IP address is bounced through several layers of encryption to appear to be at another IP address on the Tor network, so is that of the website.
Are you trying to find out how to access the dark web and what is it?
It is extremely easy to access the darknet and even easier to be detected on it if you don’t take precautions. If you are new to the darknet, this guide will help you on your way.
According to researchers, only 4% of the internet is visible to the general public.
Meaning that the remaining 96% of the internet is made up of “The Deep Web”.
Dark Web or DarkNet is a subset of the Deep Web. If you are looking to access hidden marketplace’s or darknet websites (with a .onion domain) then darknet access is done using the TOR network with the TOR browser bundle. TOR is the most widely used dark web browser.
How To Access The Darknet Guide
Step 1: Go and get yourself a good VPN (Virtual Private Network) here, use it ALL of the time, no matter if you are on TOR or not. This site here reviews the best VPN’s for use with TOR.
You should be taking your anonymity and security very seriously if you are visiting the DarkNet, especially if you are viewing any Darknet Markets.
Q: What is the Black Internet?
A: The term Black Internet usually refers to both deep web and dark web. These two terms often get confused, but in general, the black internet is considered to be a part of the internet that is not indexed by usual search engines.
It consists of millions of useful and interesting websites, but it also includes the darknet or dark web – a place on the internet where black markets are located.
Q: What is DarkNet?
A: Darknet or dark web is a part of the deep web – a non-indexed part of the web. It’s also a part of the Tor hidden network inaccessible through standard web browsers (Google Chrome, IE, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), but specific ones.
Darknet is associated with illicit activities and provides a path of communication among people who offer or use illegal services, such as illegal substances
Q: What is Dark Network?
A: Dark network refers to Tor hidden network – a part of the deep web, additionally operating on the Tor network. To access it, you need to use a special program, the Tor browser.
The content of this network is… well dark, since it is based mainly on illegal activities, which involve criminal actions, trafficking, Dark network owes its popularity to the anonymity it provides for users.","b""darknet app dowload deep web darknet app<br/> DISCLAIMER.....<br/><br/>The information contained on this Darknet app is provided for educational and informational purposes only, and should not be construed as legal advice or as an offer to perform legal services on any subject matter.

Why learn English with films?
Watching films is a lot more fun than studying with a textbook! It can also be just as useful. Here is why sitting down with a movie in English will improve your fluency:
REAL ENGLISH – Textbooks are great for learning vocabulary or grammar, but nothing is better than listening to real native English. By watching British and American films, you can listen to native English actors speaking the language in a natural way. This will help you learn modern English and sound more like a native speaker in terms of vocabulary and style.
BETTER PRONUNCIATION – Sometimes it can be hard to know how an English word is pronounced. Hearing native speakers in movies will teach you the correct way to say things. Dialogues in films also provide good examples of how sounds in words change in connected speech.
LIVE CONTEXT – When you learn a word, it can be difficult to remember what it means or how to use it. In films, words are used as part of a story and this context helps you to learn and remember them more effectively.
NATIVE ACCENTS – Across Britain and America there are many different accents used to speak English. When watching films, you will hear many regional accents being used and this will help you to understand them better. Textbooks seldom provide information about English accents.
EXPLORE CULTURE – You can learn about the culture behind the language when you watch movies in English. Language and culture are closely connected. Why not study both at the same time by watching original films?","b""If you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of going to class or reading a book, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing better than learning English through movies and film.<br/>Learn English Video, English Movies: Learn English with Subtitles is your best application to improve your English Pronunciation, English Vocabulary, English Speaking, English Listening, English Grammar, English Writing any so much more.<br/><br/>* LEARN ENGLISH: <br/>You will learn English through thousands of english movies, english films,english videos and english songs with English subtitles and you must listen english through english movie to improve skill english conversations.
