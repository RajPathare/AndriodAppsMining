•Charge

•Follow the product blog here https://communities.vmware.com/blogs/vmwpad
•IMPORTANT
If you have free VMware vSphere lincense installed on ESXi/vCenter certain number of vSphere control features like power on/off, reboot etc. may not work for some ESXi/vCenter versions. This restriction is the official policy of VMware regarding all 3rd party vSphere clients.
Those who get “License Check Error” on app startup please check the following:
1. You are trying to launch the app being logged in to the same Google account used to purchase the app.
2. You have stable Internet connection - this is required only on first app startup.
3. You have recent version of Google Play™ app installed.
vmwPAD browses datastore mounts on ESX(i) over SSH protocol (the desktop client does it over HTTPS under root account), hence you have to be sure that the SSH server is running on ESX(i) and your account is granted with corresponding permissions for the datastore file operations.
If you have any technical problems please email us to support@freeroam.me. Posting your troubles in the product reviews will not help us to investigate and fix them shortly.

This is a Windows Admin tool, intended for use by network administrators and various IT professionals.  Valid credentials are required to connect to a windows domain.
ActiveDir connects to any Windows Server Active Directory via an LDAP connection.  No additional software is required; however Active Directory Services does require a basic certificate configuration to enable encryption (req'd to set passwords).  This is typical started by adding the AD Certificate or Certificate Services role.
*RDP and VNC functions are provided by Yongtao Wang's remote tools.  All 5 rdp/vnc tools are supported and auto-detected when present, selecting pro over lite/ad supported.  Passing the current credentials (effectively SSO) only functions on Pro and Enterprise versions. http://www.remotespark.com/android_solution.html (also available on Android Market)
*TLS Unavailable Error most likely indicates the domain controller isn't capable of LDAP encryption.  A connection can usually be made by disabling TLS and SSL in the connection profile.  This will allow a non-encrypted connection with the drawback that AD LDAP will not perform password updates without encryption.
To enable LDAP Encrpytion (TLS and SSL):
*Active Directory Certificate Services should be added to one  domain controller to provide SSL/TLS security, which is needed to set passwords.  In many environments this requirement may already be in place, if not adding a private Enterprise-CA for your organization is a fairly simple process.  More information is availiable in our FAQ here:   http://www.activedir.mobi/?page_id=12
*ActiveDir is bound by the Active Directory Security policies that regulate directory security, authentication and object visibility.

In the business world, from Universities to high schools to primary schools, everywhere people are encouraged to explore their strength (core quality), their weakness (pitfall), their learning points (challenges) and their personal judgements (allergies). Without exception participants are surprised, inspired and excited to discover the relationships between these four aspects in themselves and others. By now more then a million Dutch people know about core quadrants, and over 100.000 copies of his book have been sold (in the Dutch language only). Core quadrants have virtually become part of the language.
Recognition and admission are characteristic reactions from each individual who is introduced to the simplicity and logic which made core quadrants so immensely popular.
With this application you can go one step further. Thru a 16-step Self Analysis you can build and store 16 core quadrants.
What makes this application unique, is the module Daily Reflection, which enables you to reflect on your daily interactions with others or your own behaviour. The application will then look for correlations between the core quadrants you made earlier and the issue you are reflecting on. It will then either give you feedback or invite you to make a new core quadrant. The application is designed to help you to translate the initial insights you got when you built your first core quadrants, into daily practice, in order to benefit from your increased awarenes. Somewhere in Daniel Ofman's latest book on core qualities ""Fancy Meeting Me Here..!?"" it is mentioned: ""The world is not waiting for people to become aware of their core qualities. The world is waiting for people who are willing to make their awareness productive and have meaningful interactions. When awareness about yourself has no effect on what you do and how you deal with people, building a core quadrant makes no sense and is a useless exercise.""
Why do so many people nowadays spend so little time to reflect? Maybe it is because the price we have to pay for awareness is simply too high. This price is namely responsibility. Once you realise and see what is going on and why you behave the way you do, it automatically makes you responsible. Next time you can't say anymore you didn't know. People are not bad, people are often unconscious and the moment you wake up, you bear responsibility and not everyone likes that.

People don't usually achieve impressive results simply by being good at task management. It's the ability to set legitimate goals that makes the difference. Just write down your desired outcomes to make them real. This simple technique helps you to prioritize your goals before acting on them.
Chaos Control is a task manager based on the best ideas of
GTD (Getting Things Done)

3) USE GTD CONTEXTS
Organize tasks from different projects using flexible context lists. If you are familiar with GTD you would just love this feature
4) PLAN YOUR DAY

5) USE CHAOS BOX
Put all the incoming tasks, notes and ideas into Chaos Box in order to process them later. It works similar to GTD inbox, but you can use it as a simple to-do list
6) SYNC YOUR DATA
Chaos Control works on both desktop and mobile devices. Setup an account and sync your projects across all of your devices

Yes, you can get paid even if you don't have a Paypal account: When someone sends money or echeck to your email address, Paypal will email you to let you know that you got paid. You will open Paypal account related to your email and see your money already there.
You will find how it is simple way to earn money if you can build your own 1 click payment link(s) with Make Money Paylink app and paste it wherever you want (e-mail, on your blog, facebook, in your twitter feed, whatsup, viber...).
Worldwide currencies added to database (USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, HKD, HUF, ILS, JPY, MXN, MYR, NOK, NZD, PHP, PLN, RUB, SEK, SGD, THB, TRY, TWD...).

2.Enter YOUR email (email of your paypal account, no password needed, just email address)
3.Put description of product or item you are going to sell (anything)
4.Enter amount of item
5.Choose currency (USD, EUR etc..), we suggest to work with USD, the most of the world accept USD
6.Send email with paylink to person that is going to pay you
7.Person opens email and sees link that redirects him/her to paypal to pay you. That's it!
8.When you get paid, paypal sends you notification to your email that you received money.
Testing paylink:
The 1st time when creating paylink and before sending it to your customer, you can open paylink in browser to be sure that link redirects your customer(s) to secure paypal site containing your email address/business name (if you enter wrong email when creating paylink you will not receive money, email is your identification so paypal knows where money goes).

•IMPORTANT
If you have free VMware vSphere lincense installed on ESXi/vCenter certain number of vSphere control features like power on/off, reboot etc. may not work for some ESXi/vCenter versions. This restriction is the official policy of VMware regarding all 3rd party vSphere clients.
Those who get “License Check Error” on app startup please check the following:
1. You are trying to launch the app being logged in to the same Google account used to purchase the app.
2. You have stable Internet connection - this is required only on first app startup.
3. You have recent version of Google Play™ app installed.
vmwPAD browses datastore mounts on ESX(i) over SSH protocol (the desktop client does it over HTTPS under root account), hence you have to be sure that the SSH server is running on ESX(i) and your account is granted with corresponding permissions for the datastore file operations.
If you have any technical problems please email us to support@freeroam.me. Posting your troubles in the product reviews will not help us to investigate and fix them shortly.

This is a Windows Admin tool, intended for use by network administrators and various IT professionals.  Valid credentials are required to connect to a windows domain.
ActiveDir connects to any Windows Server Active Directory via an LDAP connection.  No additional software is required; however Active Directory Services does require a basic certificate configuration to enable encryption (req'd to set passwords).  This is typical started by adding the AD Certificate or Certificate Services role.
*RDP and VNC functions are provided by Yongtao Wang's remote tools.  All 5 rdp/vnc tools are supported and auto-detected when present, selecting pro over lite/ad supported.  Passing the current credentials (effectively SSO) only functions on Pro and Enterprise versions. http://www.remotespark.com/android_solution.html (also available on Android Market)
*TLS Unavailable Error most likely indicates the domain controller isn't capable of LDAP encryption.  A connection can usually be made by disabling TLS and SSL in the connection profile.  This will allow a non-encrypted connection with the drawback that AD LDAP will not perform password updates without encryption.
To enable LDAP Encrpytion (TLS and SSL):
*Active Directory Certificate Services should be added to one  domain controller to provide SSL/TLS security, which is needed to set passwords.  In many environments this requirement may already be in place, if not adding a private Enterprise-CA for your organization is a fairly simple process.  More information is availiable in our FAQ here:   http://www.activedir.mobi/?page_id=12
*ActiveDir is bound by the Active Directory Security policies that regulate directory security, authentication and object visibility.  Valid credentials must be used to gain required access to the AD system, standard (non-admin) user accounts can be used, under normal security permissions standard accounts cannot alter data without being granted Administrator or Special access.

In the business world, from Universities to high schools to primary schools, everywhere people are encouraged to explore their strength (core quality), their weakness (pitfall), their learning points (challenges) and their personal judgements (allergies). Without exception participants are surprised, inspired and excited to discover the relationships between these four aspects in themselves and others. By now more then a million Dutch people know about core quadrants, and over 100.000 copies of his book have been sold (in the Dutch language only). Core quadrants have virtually become part of the language.
Recognition and admission are characteristic reactions from each individual who is introduced to the simplicity and logic which made core quadrants so immensely popular.
With this application you can go one step further. Thru a 16-step Self Analysis you can build and store 16 core quadrants.
What makes this application unique, is the module Daily Reflection, which enables you to reflect on your daily interactions with others or your own behaviour. The application will then look for correlations between the core quadrants you made earlier and the issue you are reflecting on. It will then either give you feedback or invite you to make a new core quadrant. The application is designed to help you to translate the initial insights you got when you built your first core quadrants, into daily practice, in order to benefit from your increased awarenes.

The world is waiting for people who are willing to make their awareness productive and have meaningful interactions. When awareness about yourself has no effect on what you do and how you deal with people, building a core quadrant makes no sense and is a useless exercise.""
Why do so many people nowadays spend so little time to reflect? Maybe it is because the price we have to pay for awareness is simply too high. This price is namely responsibility. Once you realise and see what is going on and why you behave the way you do, it automatically makes you responsible. Next time you can't say anymore you didn't know. People are not bad, people are often unconscious and the moment you wake up, you bear responsibility and not everyone likes that.

GTD (Getting Things Done)

6) SYNC YOUR DATA
Chaos Control works on both desktop and mobile devices. Setup an account and sync your projects across all of your devices
