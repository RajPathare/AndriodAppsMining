      "DragonBox Algebra 5+ Is perfect for giving young children a head start in mathematics and algebra. Children as young as five can easily begin to grasp the basic processes involved in solving linear equations without even realising that they are learning. The game is intuitive, engaging and fun, allowing anyone to learn the basics of algebra at his or her own pace.\n",
      "DragonBox Algebra 5+ covers the following algebraic concepts:\n",
      "* Addition\n",
      "* Division\n",
      "* Multiplication\n",
      "Suitable from age five and up, DragonBox Algebra 5+ gives young learners the opportunity to get familiar with the basics of equation solving.\n",
      "DragonBox uses a novel pedagogical method based on discovery and experimentation. Players learn how to solve equations in a playful and colorfull game environment where they are encouraged to experiment and be creative. By manipulating cards and trying to isolate the DragonBox on one side of the game board, the player gradually learns the operations required to isolate X on one side of an equation. Little by little, the cards are replaced with numbers and variables, revealing the addition, division and multiplication operators the player has been learning throughout the game.\n",
      "Playing does not require supervision, although parents can assist them in transferring learned skills into pen and paper equation solving. It is a great game for parents to play with their kids and can even give them an opportunity to freshen up their own math skills.\n",
      "DragonBox was developed by former math teacher Jean-Baptiste Huynh and has been heralded as a perfect example of game-based learning. As a result, it is currently forming the basis of an extensive research project by the Center For Game Science at the University of Washington.\n",

If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!!\n",
      "But first let me tell you a story….\n",
      "******************************************\n",
      "Once upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten.\n",
      "The legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space.\n",
      "All that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure!\n",
      "******************************************\n",
      "But, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost!\n",
      "And now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me?\n",

      "Every time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\n",
      "The Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n",

      "\"Fascinating.\" – NYTimes.com\n",
      "Why should I use this app?\n",
      "Out of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works?\n",
      "The purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n",
      "Why Should I not use this app?\n",
      "This app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n",
      "So how does it work?\n",
      "The Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n",
      "Is this really what radio signals look like?\n",
      "We can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n",

Throughout the app, special attention has been paid to Airway, Cardiology, Pediatrics, OBGYN, and EKG’s. These are the areas that are tested most often on national exams, because these patient types can be rare. The questions are not designed to trick, but they are designed around the best answer.

He'd lived in the French-speaking part of the country for years and wanted to expand his social life, but he always found conventional methods a little unengaging and too slow for his liking. He needed a better way to learn French – so, he created a prototype, began learning French, took a high-school language exam, and passed with a strong grade.\n",
      "Today’s Lingvist is the result of that original idea and its basic principles – and we’ve come a long way since then. Founded in Estonia, we now have over 1 million users and a super-talented and friendly team across offices in Tallinn, London, Berlin, and Tokyo.\n",

      "The secret path to language learning\n",
      "Remember the Finnish language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Finnish grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\n",
      "Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n",
      "This is how the future of language courses looks like\n",
      "The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Finnish phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.\n",
      "Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n",
      "Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.\n",
      "Learn the right Finnish pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n",
      "State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.\n",
      "Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Finnish words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Finnish clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n",
      "Useful phrases for real situations.\n",
      "Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Finnish. Mondly teaches you Finnish vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n",
      "Learn conversational Finnish.\n",
      "Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Finnish vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Finnish clearly.\n",
      "Verb conjugations.\n",
      "If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Finnish verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n",
      "Advanced Statistics.\n",
      "The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n",
      "The Leaderboard.\n",
      "See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n",
      "Adaptive Learning.\n",
      "Learning Finnish is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher. Kids will love it as well.\n",

The Steer Clear® app is part of a comprehensive program that helps young drivers reinforce positive driving behavior. Young drivers, under age 25, who complete the Steer Clear Safe Driver Discount Program, may be eligible for a discount on their State Farm® auto insurance. The Steer Clear mobile application tracks a driver's progress through pre-set learning modules of updated content including topics such as Bluetooth, distracted driving (texting/games), and special driving situations. Drivers will no longer need to manually record their trips if the program is conducted through this app. Throughout their trips, drivers will be scored and given feedback on their braking, acceleration, and cornering.   This application will also offer a code (account key) in which a mentor (parent, guardian, agent, experienced driver over 25) can receive from their driver and keep track of their driver's course progress and driving feedback/trip scores from their own device. Once a driver completes the program, they will receive a program completion certificate that they can text, email, or bring into the agent's office.  Badges have been added to Steer Clear to recognize and reward a variety of specific driving accomplishments.  The badges will help align users to shared goals of the app, such as scoring a certain percentage on a specific driving behavior, while acting as virtual, motivational status symbols.\n",

Activity based learning, using basketball games and free car games for kids, make this a perfect app for kids based on Fun learning pedagogy.

Los cuentos infantiles son una herramienta perfecta, no solo para que los niños se interesen por la lectura, sino también para que puedan potenciar y desarrollar la imaginación y su lado más creativo, fundamental para su futuro personal, social y laboral, así como para poder ver la vida desde un punto de vista positivo y lleno de ilusión. Sin embargo, a veces es difícil que los más pequeños se sientan interesados por la lectura de forma rápida y eficaz, pues muchos tienden a sentirse agobiados por las páginas o vinculados a la lectura por un sentido de la obligatoriedad impuesta por parte de los adultos.\n",

Our contest simulations are 10 weeks in duration and students receive paychecks and bills in real time and are challenged to pay their bills and save money for retirement in a 401k.  Unlike other simulations, Budget Challenge is also a competition that scores and ranks students based on how well they save, answer weekly quizzes, and manage their financial responsibilities (pay bills).  Students can compete with other students in their class and classes can compete with other classes based on class average to make the learning of life skills engaging and fun.\n",

Budget Challenge also includes many of the complicated banking and credit card fees that plague young people in the real world, so students can learn the ropes and make their costly ‘rookie’ mistakes in the safety of the classroom.\n",

      "How would you place them in orbit? If you are interested in Astronomy and looking for a powerful yet easy to use 3D universe sandbox app to create and simulate a whole new galaxy with realistic physics and gravity rules, then you’ve come to the right place. Pocket Universe, the 3D gravity sandbox game, provides you the ultimate power to explore the infinite space and simulate your own space full of different planets, gas giants, and stars. In this gravity simulator app, you get to customize literally any aspect of these particles to simulate and design your very own pocket universe sandbox. Once you are satisfied with your customized solar system (or any other combination of particles, planets, and stars), you get to easily add it to your collection, take a screenshot and share it with the world. Pocket Universe comes with a clean and neat design and the 3D simulation is so smooth that you won’t feel any difficulties or lags when bombarding your planets, or applying any condition to them. And make sure not to take the realistic gravity lensing effect as granted when looking at a black hole. It’s just fascinating. Is Pocket Universe Easy to Use? Is this 3D universe sandbox with realistic physics simulation powerful enough to create and design different planets, gas giants and stars? The answer is a BIG yes! But are the simulation tools easy to use? The answer is even a BIGGER yes! The user interface is so friendly, that you’ll get used to it after going through the step-by-step tutorial and trying available tools for a few times. After that, you just need to use your imagination and be creative to form some unique pocket universes with gravity simulator based on physics rules. If you are going to redesign our lovely solar system in our galaxy, you’ll have access to all the planets (mars, moon, earth, mercury etc, and you have the power to unlock new worlds by meeting the right conditions, colliding with the right objects, and altering mass and sea level while keeping the temperature stable. To smash stuff together and create new planets, make sure to crash the right ones together. Tip: To raise the sea level, hit a planet with ice meteors, and use rock meteors to lower the sea level.\n",

      "Who is it for?\n",
      "Ureka is designed for both scientists and the general public. This extends from MDs who don’t have access to publications and need to learn about current findings in the medical industry, to graduate students who have to rifle through hundreds of papers per day just to determine which publication contains the most current, relevant, and robust research results. Ureka will keep both academics and science enthusiasts abreast of the current trends in science inside a collaborative, user-friendly mobile platform.\n",
      "What are the key features?\n",
      "Ureka combines all of the best features of Instagram, Twitter, Slack, Linked-In, AcademicJobs, and more. Key features and capabilities include: post an image and description of the results to relevant science channels; subscribe and follow scientific channels specific to your interests to see the latest results in that research area; all channels have a trending feed and a time-dependent feed, so you can see the most recent and/or the most active posts; measurable in-app metrics that track user impact and activity, which can be used in the future for hiring practices and in-app awards. Future versions will include job hunting tools, conference support, private sub-channels, and animated posts.\n",
      "How much does it cost?\n",
      "Ureka is FREE. We believe that science should be open to everyone, but the current publishing schema is a crime against humanity. Taxpayer funds are pumped into institutions to fund scientific progress. Scientists then give their work away for free (or sometimes even at a cost) to publishers, who in turn make a large profit by hiding those results behind paywalls that cost readers hundreds to thousands of dollars per paper. Ureka will remove the proverbial middleman and provide the same services (and more) at no cost to the user.

      "Darknet DEEP WEB...\n",
      "This is but a tiny corner of the internet, and the Dark Web and the Deep Web loom in much shadier corners. Using Tor you can access them, but should you even want to visit the Dark Web or the Deep Web?\n",
      "Let's take a tour to help you make up your mind.\n",
      "What is the Darknet Dark Web?\n",
      "The DarkWeb is a term that refers specifically to a collection of websites that exist on an encrypted network and cannot be found by using traditional search engines or visited by using traditional browsers.\n",
      "Almost all sites on the so-called Darknet DarkWeb hide their identity using the Tor encryption tool. You may know Tor for its ability to hide your identity and activity. You can use Tor to spoof your location so it appears you're in a different country to where you're really located, making it much like using a VPN service.\n",
      "When a website is run through Darknet Tor it has much the same effect.\n",
      "Indeed, it multiplies the effect. To visit a site on the Darknet that is using Tor encryption, the web user needs to be using Tor. Just as the end user's IP address is bounced through several layers of encryption to appear to be at another IP address on the Tor network, so is that of the website.\n",
      "Are you trying to find out how to access the dark web and what is it?\n",
      "It is extremely easy to access the darknet and even easier to be detected on it if you don’t take precautions. If you are new to the darknet, this guide will help you on your way.\n",
      "According to researchers, only 4% of the internet is visible to the general public.\n",
      "Meaning that the remaining 96% of the internet is made up of “The Deep Web”.\n",
      "Dark Web or DarkNet is a subset of the Deep Web. If you are looking to access hidden marketplace’s or darknet websites (with a .onion domain) then darknet access is done using the TOR network with the TOR browser bundle. TOR is the most widely used dark web browser.\n",
      "How To Access The Darknet Guide\n",
      "Step 1: Go and get yourself a good VPN (Virtual Private Network) here, use it ALL of the time, no matter if you are on TOR or not. This site here reviews the best VPN’s for use with TOR.\n",
      "You should be taking your anonymity and security very seriously if you are visiting the DarkNet, especially if you are viewing any Darknet Markets.\n",
      "Q: What is the Black Internet?\n",
      "A: The term Black Internet usually refers to both deep web and dark web. These two terms often get confused, but in general, the black internet is considered to be a part of the internet that is not indexed by usual search engines.\n",
      "It consists of millions of useful and interesting websites, but it also includes the darknet or dark web – a place on the internet where black markets are located.\n",
      "Q: What is DarkNet?\n",
      "A: Darknet or dark web is a part of the deep web – a non-indexed part of the web. It’s also a part of the Tor hidden network inaccessible through standard web browsers (Google Chrome, IE, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), but specific ones.\n",
      "Darknet is associated with illicit activities and provides a path of communication among people who offer or use illegal services, such as illegal substances\n",
      "Q: What is Dark Network?\n",
      "A: Dark network refers to Tor hidden network – a part of the deep web, additionally operating on the Tor network. To access it, you need to use a special program, the Tor browser.\n",
      "The content of this network is… well dark, since it is based mainly on illegal activities, which involve criminal actions, trafficking, Dark network owes its popularity to the anonymity it provides for users.

      "Watching films is a lot more fun than studying with a textbook! It can also be just as useful. Here is why sitting down with a movie in English will improve your fluency:\n",
      "REAL ENGLISH – Textbooks are great for learning vocabulary or grammar, but nothing is better than listening to real native English. By watching British and American films, you can listen to native English actors speaking the language in a natural way. This will help you learn modern English and sound more like a native speaker in terms of vocabulary and style.\n",
      "BETTER PRONUNCIATION – Sometimes it can be hard to know how an English word is pronounced. Hearing native speakers in movies will teach you the correct way to say things. Dialogues in films also provide good examples of how sounds in words change in connected speech.\n",
      "LIVE CONTEXT – When you learn a word, it can be difficult to remember what it means or how to use it. In films, words are used as part of a story and this context helps you to learn and remember them more effectively.\n",
      "NATIVE ACCENTS – Across Britain and America there are many different accents used to speak English. When watching films, you will hear many regional accents being used and this will help you to understand them better. Textbooks seldom provide information about English accents.\n",
      "EXPLORE CULTURE – You can learn about the culture behind the language when you watch movies in English. Language and culture are closely connected. Why not study both at the same time by watching original films? Tulsa Regional STEM Alliance is an intermediary organization who's focus is to build broad, deep and innovative STEM pathways for all students to access high-impact careers.\n",
